Another big performance jump for Dart - this time on the server.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>"<a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2014/04/dart-13-dramatically-improves-server.html?spref=bl">Dart News &amp; Updates: Dart 1.3 dramatically improves server-side perform...</a>: With Dart SDK 1.3, weâ€™ve improved performance of async code running in the Dart VM and made substantial improvements to dart:io."</i><br /><br /><br /><br />It has been a while since this blog covered server side code - hope to have a sample up soon covering a simple app.
