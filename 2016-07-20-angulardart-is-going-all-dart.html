We're happy to announce that we’re splitting the Angular 2 codebase into two flavors – a Dart version and a TypeScript/JavaScript version –&nbsp;and creating a dedicated <a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular">AngularDart</a> team. <br /><br />This is amazing news for Dart developers because:<br /><br /><ul><li>The framework will feel more like idiomatic Dart.</li><li>It will make use of Dart features that couldn't work with the TypeScript flavor. </li><li>It will be faster.</li></ul><br />This is equally great news for our TypeScript and JavaScript developers, by the way. Cleaner API, performance gains, easier contributions. <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/07/a-dedicated-team-for-angulardart.html">Read more</a> on the Angular blog.<br /><br />Angular 2 for Dart is used by many teams at Google. <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/03/the-new-adwords-ui-uses-dart-we-asked.html">Most famously</a> by the AdWords team, but many other Google teams build large, mobile-friendly web apps. Some of the top requests from these teams were: make the API feel like Dart, provide a faster edit-refresh cycle, and improve application performance.<br /><br />That’s exactly what we aim to do. We believe we can significantly improve both the performance and usability of AngularDart. For example, in the 2 weeks since we started work on the purely Dart version, we were already able to unleash <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dev_compiler/blob/master/STRONG_MODE.md">strong mode</a> on the code and were able to significantly improve the code quality (fixed 1000+ warnings).<br /><br /><h3>One more thing</h3><br />We're also happy to announce plans to release our <strong>library of Material Design components for Angular 2 Dart</strong>. These components are built purely in Dart, and they’re used in production Google apps. Watch <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/">news.dartlang.org</a> for updates.<br /><br />Here’s just one of the many Angular 2 Dart components we plan to release:<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAVRnMD6LZ0/V4Z3pcz2b5I/AAAAAAAANXs/I2iKy2cgwmo84LnCZMZU8PmBqdAQJSR4QCKgB/s1600/angulardart-material-component-preview.gif" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WAVRnMD6LZ0/V4Z3pcz2b5I/AAAAAAAANXs/I2iKy2cgwmo84LnCZMZU8PmBqdAQJSR4QCKgB/s1600/angulardart-material-component-preview.gif" /></a><br /><br />Dart was designed "batteries included" – it’s not just a programming language, but also a set of <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch03.html">stable libraries</a>, <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/">solid tools</a>, a great framework — and soon, a repository of battle-tested UI widgets.<br /><br />The components aren’t ready to be publicly released yet, but if you were thinking about learning Dart, now is a good time to <a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/guides/get-started">start</a>. By the time you’re ready to build production apps, you’ll have the building blocks at your disposal.<br /><br /><h3>Dig into AngularDart</h3><br /><code>angular2 2.0.0-beta.18</code> is now available on the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular2">pub site</a>. You can look at the source, file issues and create pull requests at <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2">dart-lang/angular2</a>. If you already use AngularDart in a project, you can use <code>pub upgrade</code> now to get the latest version. Please join the <a href="https://gitter.im/dart-lang/angular2">AngularDart gitter</a> to ask general questions.
