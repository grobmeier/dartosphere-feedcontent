<p>The road to Dart 1.2 continues with the release of to the DEV channel. Full announcement <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/misc/RT2IeosSUbg">here</a>. Highlights include the addition of Dart Formatter, increased performance and stability, plus more support for attributes.</p> <p>Diego Rocha has a great article on the all important topic of concurrency - vital in today's multi-core world.  <a href="http://diegorochablog.wordpress.com/2014/02/18/worker-dart-concurrent-programming-does-not-have-to-be-hard/">Worker: Dart concurrent programming does not have to be hard</a>. Even features <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci</a> numbers! </p> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-byT7vaEVMiM/Uwe2u-71zkI/AAAAAAAAy-0/LT1cRmzqdlA/s1600/angularlogo.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-byT7vaEVMiM/Uwe2u-71zkI/AAAAAAAAy-0/LT1cRmzqdlA/s400/angularlogo.png" /></a> <p>cozy-porcupine. There - I said it! As you this is the codename for the latest angular.dart release which is at 0.9.8 so approaching 1.0 sometime soon. All the details over on <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/v0.9.8/CHANGELOG.md#v0.9.8">Github</a>.</p> <p>I always enjoy talks from the Dart team themselves. Bob Nystrom's recent talk '<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/dart-introduction">Dart for the Language Enthusiast</a>' is available as an MP3 download and the slides are available too.</p> <p>If you are interested in Dart game development, there's some interesting early footage of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bornander">Fredrik Bornander</a>'s 'Lost Souls'</p> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-epMFOkAQdbQ/Uwe0UF-_CHI/AAAAAAAAy-o/8e6XzMFDON0/s1600/DartHTML5game.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-epMFOkAQdbQ/Uwe0UF-_CHI/AAAAAAAAy-o/8e6XzMFDON0/s400/DartHTML5game.png" /></a> <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qiah2Fs1Mgc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+BrunoSkvorc/posts">Bruno Skvorc</a> has written a great article <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/client-server-dart-app-getting-started/">A Client-Server Dart App From Scratch</a>. This is part one of a series starting with setting up a development environment and a Vagrant VM. SQL and PHPStorm are also touched upon.</p> <p>Finally, I'd just like to mention that this blog should be picking up the pace soon. There's some more demo's on the way and a game. Have fun building with Dart this week! Thanks for reading - the visits, sharing and responses make it all worthwhile.</p>
