Folks, I'm happy to tell you that we've just tagged release 1.0 (industrious-pangolin) of AngularDart on github.<br /><br />In 1.0, you'll find the last of our changes to the fundamental nature of the AngularDart APIs. We've simplified our design to eliminate much of the boilerplate that was involved in writing new components in our previous 0.x versions. We hope that the result is an AngularDart that's easier to understand and use.<br /><br />For details on what's new, see the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">changelog</a>.<br /><br />Declaring 1.0 also represents a stability milestone for the AngularDart team. From here on out, you can expect bug fixes and minor updates, but we will not be introducing any major new breaking changes or refactoring of the core principles.<br /><br />We're going to channel our bold breaking changes into the next generation of Angular, Angular 2, with a single unified codebase for AngularJS and AngularDart.<br /><br />We're also looking forward to <a href="http://ngeurope.org/" target="_blank">ngEurope</a> in just a few weeks, where we're excited to meet many of you and chat about what's coming next.<br /><br />Thanks to our superheroic contributors on this latest iteration since 0.14: Aric Huang, Chirayu Krishnappa, Diana Salsbury, James deBoer, Jare Fagbemi, Julie Ralph, Karl Klose, Matias Niemel√§, Mehmet Fidanboylu, Michael Krog, Misko Hevery, Naomi Black, Pavel Jbanov, Rado Kirov, Victor Berchet, Jake Rote, Kobayash Taishi, Victor Savkin.<br /><br /><br />
