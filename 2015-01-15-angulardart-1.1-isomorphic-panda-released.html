This is primarily a bug fix release. Angular.dart's dependencies have been&nbsp;updated to their newest versions. A number of fixes went into the shadow-dom polyfill&nbsp;and forms. Support for Observable objects in change detection has been improved.<br /><br />For more information check out the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/03044ff58c1f87f5db7ccca2de4b453e005b5b5f/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.<br /><br />Big thanks to our v1.1 contributors:<div>Andreas Kirsch, Matias Niemel√§, Pavel Jbanov, Rado Kirov, Segaud Kevin, Victor Berchet, Alexander Dembinsky, ashelansky, Victor Savkin.</div>
