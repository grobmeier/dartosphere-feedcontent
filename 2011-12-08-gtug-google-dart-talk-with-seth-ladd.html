<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h93MkgAw5s">Seth Ladd on Google Dart</a> Seth Ladd is
a &quot;Google Advocate&quot;. In this talk he speaks about Google Dart and
explains why it is cool (and yes, I agree it is cool). This is a pretty
nice brown bag with a size of 70 minutes. If you still have no clue on
Dart look at this video. And you surely can convince your Boss to pay a
Pizza for you and your team.</p>
