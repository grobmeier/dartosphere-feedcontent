<p>Hey everyone! Welcome to the new Redstone.dart blog :)</p>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve received a lot of feedback and questions about Redstone through many different channels, such as github, google plus, hangouts, e-mail and so on. 
It&#39;s really cool to see other developers excited about this project, but I&#39;ve just realized that we need a proper place to discuss about it.</p>

<p>So, to fix this issue, I&#39;ve created a mailing list for us:</p>

<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/redstonedart">http://groups.google.com/d/forum/redstonedart</a></p>

<p>If you have questions, or want to give some feedback about the project, don&#39;t hesitate to join the group and send us a message. Although, if you find a bug, or want to contribute some code, please file an issue at our <a href="https://github.com/luizmineo/redstone.dart">GitHub</a> page.</p>
