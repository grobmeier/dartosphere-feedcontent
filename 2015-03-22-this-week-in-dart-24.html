<p>Top story this week is the availability of the release candidate for version 1.9 which is available on the <u><a href=”https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download-archive/”>DEV Channel</a></u>. This is closely followed by the opening of registration for the first <u><a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2015/03/announcing-dart-developer-summit.html">Dart Developer Summit</a></u> (April 28-29) - should be a great couple of days of Dart Sessions which will be streamed and recorded. </p> <p>A new article appeared on the <u><a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=2747873">ACM</a></u> website, with details of the new async and generator features. This gets quite involved but is a good read! </p> <p>The <u><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals">Dart Enhancement Proposals</a></u> repository has grown already with some great ideas, for example <u><a href="https://github.com/leafpetersen/dep-generic-methods/blob/master/proposal.md">Generic Methods in Dart</a></u>.  <p>Jana Moudrá has an <u><a href="http://www.moudra.net/2015/03/i-would-like-sortable-list-for-my-dart.html">interesting post</a></u> on two Dart packages for sortable lists & drag and drop.</p> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cia3xAxgoO4/VQt29O6sNuI/AAAAAAABnJk/PN4l5GlWUKw/w506-h305/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-03-19%2Bat%2B6.24.40%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cia3xAxgoO4/VQt29O6sNuI/AAAAAAABnJk/PN4l5GlWUKw/w506-h305/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-03-19%2Bat%2B6.24.40%2BPM.png" /></a> <p>Finally, <u><a href="https://dartpad.dartlang.org/">Dart Pad</a></u> gained a very important feature - code completion!</p>
