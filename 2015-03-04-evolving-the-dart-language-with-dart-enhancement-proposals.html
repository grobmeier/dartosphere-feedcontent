In July 2014, <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2014/07/ecma-approves-1st-edition-of-dart.html">Ecma published the first version of the Dart language specification</a>. Ecma TC52 continues to release updated versions with new features (for example, <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2014/12/enums-and-async-primitives-in-dart.html">async/await</a>). Our developers have asked for more insight into the discussion process, and for a formal way to seed the spec process with proposals. Today, we're happy to announce <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals">Dart Enhancement Proposals</a> as the primary way for the Dart team and the larger Dart community to work together to evolve the Dart language and libraries.<br /><br />To make a great language that can be used to write great programs means we need to work together. The DEP process is how we do that. We want to:<br /><ul><li>Create an open, collaborative, and inclusive Dart ecosystem.</li><li>Be responsive to developer needs.</li><li>Give the community a sense of shared ownership and stewardship.</li><li>Be transparent about the work leading to Dart language changes.</li><li>Ensure rationale for changes (or decisions not to change) is clearly communicated.</li><li>Close the loop and check if stakeholders are happy before a change is finalized.</li></ul>Anyone can create and champion a DEP, but this does not mean that Dart is a democracy. The DEP process is a key part of how we decide how Dart should evolve, but it's only one part. DEPs are managed by the DEP committee. The committee meets on a regular basis to review the proposals. Because Dart is an open Ecma specification, TC52 has final say on what changes land in the spec.<br /><div><br /></div><div>We're just getting started with the DEP process. To learn more, check out the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals">GitHub repo</a> for more details, review some of the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals/issues">initial proposals</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_enhancement_proposals/tree/master/Meetings">review the notes</a> from the first DEP meetings. You can also join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!forum/core-dev">DEP discussion mailing list</a>.</div>
