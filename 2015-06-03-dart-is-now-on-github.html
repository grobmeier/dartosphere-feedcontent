<a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> is an open-source programming language, with contributors working on the language, libraries, tools, and packages. To make working with our community even easier, today we are announcing that we've fully settled into our new home on GitHub. We invite you to follow along and contribute at <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang">https://github.com/dart-lang</a>. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RzGaLZvvOFg/VW9DTlw8A3I/AAAAAAAAEtA/TARkyXqRxUo/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-06-03%2Bat%2B11.11.09%2BAM.png" /></div><br />The Dart SDK now has its own <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk">repository</a>, joining the numerous Dart tools and packages already in our <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang">GitHub org</a>. Weâ€™ve moved all the SDK issues over (keeping the original issue numbers!), and <a href="http://dartbug.com/">dartbug.com</a> now points to GitHub's issue tracker for the Dart SDK.  <br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Getting-The-Source">Getting the SDK source</a> is easy, and we've documented the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/wiki/Contributing">contribution workflow</a>. Our development tools are optimized for code reviews on <a href="https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/">Rietveld</a>, Chromium's code review system, and they make it easy to start a review and cleanly land a patch. For very small patches, contributors can use a standard GitHub pull request.<br /><br />One of the easiest ways to start contributing to Dart is to work on one of our packages. Individual packages (for example, <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/args">args</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/http">http</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/test">test</a>) now have their own repos, complete with their own issue trackers and <a href="https://chromegw.corp.google.com/i/client.dart.packages/console">buildbots</a>. To get started, check them out and find issues marked "help wanted". And of course, we encourage everyone to continue filing issues with <a href="http://dartbug.com/">dartbug.com</a>.<br /><br />We hope our move to GitHub helps more Dartisans become active participants in the future of Dart.
