As of the 1.19 release, Dart supports an optional mode, called <em>strong mode</em>, that supports stronger static typing. Strong mode helps you find bugs sooner and contributes to making Dart a sound language.<br /><br />To learn more about using strong mode to enable soundness, including the how, the why, and fixes for common problems you might encounter, see:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/sound-dart">Sound Dart</a><br />How and why to write sound Dart code, and how to use strong mode to enable soundness.</li><li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/sound-faq">Sound Dart: FAQ</a><br />A list of common questions for those who are interested in stronger static typing.</li><li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/sound-problems">Sound Dart: Fixing Common Problems</a><br />How to fix errors and warnings you may encounter when writing sound Dart code.</li></ul>
