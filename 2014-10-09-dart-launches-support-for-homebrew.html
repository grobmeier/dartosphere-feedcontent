Developers can now easily install and update <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/">Dart SDK</a> and <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/">Dartium</a> on Macs with Homebrew, a popular package manager for Mac OS X. Both the stable SDK and (for the more adventurous) the dev channel SDK are available via Homebrew.<br /><br />It's easy to get started. After you <a href="http://brew.sh/">install Homebrew</a>, run these commands to install the stable channel Dart SDK and Dartium:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; brew tap dart-lang/dart<br />&nbsp; brew install dart<br />&nbsp; brew install dartium # if you build Dart client apps</span><div><br /><div>When there is a new build of the SDK or Dartium, run these commands to stay up to date:</div><div><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; brew update<br />&nbsp; brew upgrade dart<br />&nbsp; brew upgrade dartium</span></div><div><br />Use Homebrew if you build server-side Dart apps, or you are not using <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/">Dart Editor</a> (for example, if you use <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> or <a href="https://github.com/guillermooo/dart-sublime-bundle">Sublime</a>). To download Dart Editor, you can continue to use the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html">download</a> page.</div><div><br /></div><div>We hope our support for Homebrew makes it easy for our Mac developers to stay on the latest versions of the Dart SDK. Thanks to the Homebrew developers for answering our questions along the way. We look forward to your <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/homebrew-dart/issues">feedback</a>.<div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"></div></div></div>
