Dart 1.16 is now <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">available</a>. This release includes important updates to our tools.<br /><div><br /><h2>Faster developer tools</h2><div><br /></div>In this release, we've been working closely with our <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/03/the-new-adwords-ui-uses-dart-we-asked.html">users at Google</a> to make sure Dart is even more productive for developers. We've optimized how <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/">Dartium</a> loads applications, improving the time it takes to open an application up to 40%. We also continue to invest in faster code analysis and quicker JavaScript compile times. You should see improved performance in this and future releases.</div><div><br /><h2>Updated HTML APIs</h2><div><br /></div>In Dart 1.15 we updated Dartium to Chrome 45 from Chrome 39. In this release, we've updated our browser APIs – dart:html, dart:svg, etc. – to align with these changes. While most of these changes involve new and lesser used APIs, you should verify your application code to find and fix possible breaks.</div><div><br /><h2>And more...</h2><div><br /></div>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">SDK changelog</a> has details about all of the updates in Dart 1.16 SDK. <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">Get it now</a>.</div>
