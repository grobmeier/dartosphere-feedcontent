This year, we’re thrilled to have more presentations about using Dart than ever before at I/O.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mk0XfsQKxGo/U6P3_TtK5KI/AAAAAAAACLY/hPS1JffX-V8/s1600/dart_io.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mk0XfsQKxGo/U6P3_TtK5KI/AAAAAAAACLY/hPS1JffX-V8/s1600/dart_io.png" height="640" width="408" /></a></div><br />If you’re keen to learn more about what the Dart team and Dart users have in store for you, be sure to either check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/schedule">online schedule</a> or install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.samples.apps.iosched">I/O app</a>.
