With Dart SDK 1.3, we’ve improved performance of async code running in the Dart VM and made substantial improvements to dart:io. This results in some of our experimental <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve">HTTP benchmarks</a> now running at more than twice the speed of the previous release. We continuously track these benchmarks on the new <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/performance/io/">Dart I/O performance page</a>.<br /><br /><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-adc30685-46dc-01c7-30bb-1dc95115bf7f"><img height="364px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_FGJy_3nbS8ncZ5nc8scNNCEX2K0ZPSX4Ca1aoEdK8AjtkVBH9Itv3Oy-7kO5zrdaeyhNEqgkjXypBG3jGjYab7eTrwq3Iodchv1PLoCgA344fkE3vIQLBwEO4AAk3SHbA" style="-webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad); border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad);" width="624px;" /></span></div><div>In the Dart Editor, “Run as JavaScript” now uses <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/cmd/pub-serve.html">pub serve</a>, which serves your web app’s assets and does code transformations using a development server built into pub. This makes your development workflow faster and more streamlined.</div><div><br /></div><div>For users of <a href="https://angulardart.org/">AngularDart</a> we have other good news in store: the Dart Editor now has support for Angular code completions and improved Angular analysis and refactoring support. Building web apps using Dart and Angular just got even more productive!</div><div><br /></div><div>You can download Dart 1.3 from the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html">Download Dart page</a>. If you are running the Dart Editor, you can update by checking "About Dart Editor". Don’t forget to tell us what you build with Dart in our <a href="http://g.co/dartisans">Google+ community</a>!</div>
