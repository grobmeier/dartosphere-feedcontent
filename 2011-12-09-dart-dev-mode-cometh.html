As of yesterday, you can get &#8220;dev mode light&#8221; functionality in Dart using the frog compiler. The new frog &#8220;tip&#8221; will compile your Dart script to JS on the fly, so the workflow is edit your Dart script save refresh in browser see changes in 1 or 2 sec You can already do this in [&#8230;]
