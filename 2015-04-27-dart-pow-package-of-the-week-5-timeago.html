<p>Sorry for the lack of posts - April has been busy! A combination of holidays, work deadlines and writing a book has made blogging impossible. The good news is that it is a Dart book - more details as I can share them!</p> <p>Who is ready for another - Dart POW? A weekly look at an interesting Package on <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/timeago">timeago </a> is a Dart library for creating fuzzy timestamps, such as "15 minutes ago". Great for human friendly labeling of dynamic interfaces.</p> <pre style="padding: 3px 5px; border: 3px double silver;"><br />import 'package:timeago/timeago.dart';<br /><br />main() async {<br />    TimeAgo time = new TimeAgo();<br />    int current = new DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch;<br />    <br />    print(time.timeAgo(current - (15 * 60 * 1000))); // 15 minutes ago<br />    <br />    //change locale<br />    await time.changeLocale("es");<br />    <br />    print(time.timeAgo(current - (15 * 60 * 1000))); // hace 15 minutos<br />}<br /></pre> <p>Try out the live demo <a href=”http://andresaraujo.github.io/timeago.dart/”>here</a>.</p> <p>Feel free to leave a comment with suggestions for the next Dart POW post! Don't be too shy to suggest your own package :-)</p>
