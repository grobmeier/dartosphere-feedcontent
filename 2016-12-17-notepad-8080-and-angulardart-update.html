<p>As detailed in previous posts, I have been working on a notepad application using AngularDart. There's not been a blog post for  while but it has slowly and steadily progressed.</p> <p>AngularDart has had a couple of big updates since I started this and not caused any issues. So I am finding it very stable and easy to relate to Angular1. There's a lot of Angular features that I haven't used in there yet so I will continue to scour articles and samples. That said, the focus for np8080 will probably be on the end user functionality rather than the implementation technology. Adding markdown support was very easy thanks to the package on pub - the real battle was with the CSS.</p> <p>I am going to continue to develop the application - I use it almost daily in the day job for notes and as a scratchpad. Feel free to raise a <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/np8080">feature request</a>! I am pondering making an Electron version at least for Windows.</p> <p>Looks quite good on my Chromebook! Try it out at <a href="http://np8080.win">np8080.win</a></p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HOXwT697s6M/WFU04kZA4uI/AAAAAAABVwc/2ASxutAp7bUNiKSYYTtfIUuD3AIIlmrHgCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2B2016-12-17%2Bat%2B12.43.18.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HOXwT697s6M/WFU04kZA4uI/AAAAAAABVwc/2ASxutAp7bUNiKSYYTtfIUuD3AIIlmrHgCLcB/s400/Screenshot%2B2016-12-17%2Bat%2B12.43.18.png" width="400" height="176" /></a></p> <p>Finally, on an unrelated note, for a limited time my Dart book is <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/dart-example">just $5 for the ebook version</a>!</p>
