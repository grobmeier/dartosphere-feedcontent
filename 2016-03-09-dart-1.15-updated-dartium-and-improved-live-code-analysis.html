Dart 1.15 is now <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">available</a>. This release includes important updates to our tools.<br /><br /><h2>Updated Dartium version</h2><br /><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/">Dartium</a> has been updated from Chrome 39 to Chrome 45. While the underlying browser has been changed, there have <i>been no changes</i>&nbsp;in this release to the corresponding APIs in dart:html, dart:svg, etc. We will roll out API updates in a future release to maximize stability and ease migration.<br /><br /><h2>Improved live code analysis</h2><br />The Dart analyzer service, used by WebStorm, IntelliJ, and Atom has been hardened in 1.15. Using error reports from Dart users within Google, we've been able to eliminate many common sources of instability. You should notice a much more reliable experience within your favorite Dart IDE.<br /><br /><h2>Release cadence changes</h2><br />Historically the Dart SDK has released a new stable release roughly every 2-3 months. The release duration has varied from release to release. Going forward we are going to attempt to ship on a more predictable schedule with a new release of the SDK every six weeks. A release candidate will be made available roughly a week before the final release.<br /><br /><h2>And more...</h2><br />The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">SDK changelog</a> has details about all of the updates in Dart 1.15 SDK. <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">Get it now</a>.
