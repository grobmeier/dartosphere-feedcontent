It's easy to throw "darts" at Google's nascent computer language from the comfy worlds of javascript, java, phython, .net, or whatever your favorite language is.<br /><br />I get it. <br /><br />You can look at the Dart spec and the roadmap and easily say "Nothing new here." (not true), or &nbsp;"Nothing compelling enough for me to switch from my favorite language." <br /><br />I get that too. &nbsp;But there's one problem: &nbsp;You're missing the point.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">Dart Is An Opportunity For You</span><br /><br />First of all, if you look at computer languages through a religious&nbsp;lens, then you should stop reading now, because nothing will convince you otherwise. &nbsp;If however, you view computer languages as tools, and your focus is applying the right tools to the right jobs, then read on!<br /><br />The point is Dart is a huge opportunity for you, yes YOU, to actually help shape the future of a new computer language; a language with the goal to unify client-side and server-side development, and to better enable rich, immersive&nbsp;applications for the Web. <br /><br />Google has made the entire project open source. &nbsp;You can submit patches directly to the project (following the guidelines) and your code may be accepted. &nbsp;I know this has happened already on at least one occasion. <br /><br />Google has opened a communication channel on many fronts, giving you access to the team who are actually writing the code. &nbsp;This level of access is nearly unprecedented for projects of this scale. &nbsp;In fact, as far as I can tell, the entire Dart team is involved in this discourse. &nbsp;On several&nbsp;occasions, I've seen Gilad Bracha (he is writing the Dart specification) personally respond to feedback.<br /><br />The Dart team provides a bug submission page, and they actively use it! &nbsp;If you submit a bug, you can be sure that it will be evaluated. &nbsp;Feature enhancements can be submitted there too.<br /><br />The Dart team has made very early versions of the entire tool-set available for evaluation. &nbsp;Out of the box, you already get a multi-platform IDE, a package manager (called "pub"), and an SDK, and the language spec is only at v0.10!<br /><br />Don't expect every great idea you have ever had for a language to be accepted without scrutiny, however. &nbsp;Do expect that you'll be engaged in a constructive dialog, and you can be sure that your comments will be, at the very least, carefully considered.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">How To Engage</span><br />Before you submit suggestions or ideas, please do the read up to see if the topic hasn't been brought up before. &nbsp;If you aren't sure, speak up anyway - it's OK.<br /><br /><ul><li>Dart Home Page: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">http://www.dartlang.org</a></li><li>Discussion Board: &nbsp;<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/group/misc/topics">https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/group/misc/topics</a></li><li>Source Code:&nbsp; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dart/">http://code.google.com/p/dart/</a></li><li>Bug/Feature Submissions:&nbsp; <a href="https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list">https://code.google.com/p/dart/issues/list</a></li><li>Google+ stream:&nbsp; <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23dartlang">https://plus.google.com/s/%23dartlang</a></li><li>Follow this guy on G+:&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/118397406534237711570/about" target="_blank">Seth Ladd - Developer Advocate for the Dart Project</a></li></ul><br /><br /><br /><br />
