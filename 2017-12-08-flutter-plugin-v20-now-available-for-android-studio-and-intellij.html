The M20 release of the Flutter plugin is now available! Fixes and improvements include:<br /><ul><li>improved the "Open with Xcode..." logic to work better for plugin projects</li><li>improved flutter run console filtering</li><li>improvements to unit test running support</li><li>bug fixes to project creation in order to properly respect custom creation options (such as target language)</li><li>and, bug fixes to issues encountered when deleting projects</li></ul>For existing users, Android Studio / IntelliJ should prompt you to update. If not, select 'Check for updates...' from the main menu. New users can install the plugin by selecting ‘Preferences’ &gt; ‘Plugins’ and searching for ‘Flutter’ (or, see our <a href="https://flutter.io/intellij-setup/#installing-the-plugins">install instructions</a>).<br /><br />Also available is the new package site, <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/">pub.dartlang.org</a>, which now makes it easier to find Dart packages for use with Flutter.
