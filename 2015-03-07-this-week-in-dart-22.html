<p>It has been quite a while since the last TWID! It has been an interesting week for Dart so a good chance to kick it off again. Watch out for more weekly features on the blog.</p> <p>The journey to 1.9 continues and it is taking a bit longer than usual - Kevin Moore explains <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/announce/tVtyIe3MUFY/discussion">why and the new features</a>. Kevin has also commented on the announcement that the Angular 2.0 project is switching to Typescript in the wonderfully titled post <a href="http://work.j832.com/2015/03/angulartsjsatdartwtf.html">Angular.ts.js.at.dart.wtf</a>.</p> <p>You can try out 1.9 now by using the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download-archive/">unstable channel</a> for Dart. Two features I am looking forward to hitting stable are the improved analyser and an improved code formatter. It's great when the tools are working <b>WITH</b> you!</p> <p>Hacker News has a great discussion thread for Q+A's on the new <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9146631">Dart Enhancement Proposals</a>.</p> <p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sBMK5trc4pQ/VOWgTLBdDrI/AAAAAAAADxw/KZLZKcIffUk/s1600/dart_designer.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sBMK5trc4pQ/VOWgTLBdDrI/AAAAAAAADxw/KZLZKcIffUk/s320/dart_designer.png" /></a></p> <p>Finally, catching up with some slightly older news, <a href="http://dartdesigner.github.io/">Dart Designer</a> has been released. - <i>"Graphical tooling based on Eclipse Sirius for the Dart programming language."</i> - Check out the video below.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCbhPVMYZ30" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
