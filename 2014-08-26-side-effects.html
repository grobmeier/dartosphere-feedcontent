<p><del>Dart, like many other languages, uses pass-by-reference for complex objects, and pass-by-value for simple objects.</del> This can occasionally be confusing or surprising to someone new to the language. It may not always be clear when your function will have side effects or not. So I decided to create a simple project which helps highlight when you can expect your function to have side effects.</p>
<p>This post uses terminology which is totally wrong. <strong>See my follow up post <a href="http://blog.butlermatt.me/2014/08/side-effects-may-include-being-wrong/" title="Side Effects may include… being wrong!">Side Effects may include&#8230; Being Wrong!</a></strong> The table here is still good, but has been slightly modified to accurately reflect the terminology and what is going on under-the-hood. Apart from that I&#8217;m leaving the remainder of the post as is, however please, please please read the follow up post.</p>

<p>Of note in particular is the <code>final</code> version of List and Map. Both will allow new elements to be added, and existing elements to be modified</p>
<p>In my example, I wanted to test both adding a value, as well as modifying a value. For the basic types, there really isn&#8217;t a distinction worth noting. However for more complex types like <code>List</code> and <code>Map</code> one can either change the value, or add a value to the collection so I wanted to demonstrate both, though both behave similarly. In order to accommodate multiple functions which can could be used for the tests, without being too repetitive, I used a <code>typedef</code> for a modify function, and in my testing function, accepted a modify function as an argument.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code class="language-dart">library side_effects;

typedef void modify(var arg);

// ...
void testFunction(var arg, modify mod) {
  if(arg is num) print('Testing Num:'); // Num captures int, double and num types
  if(arg is bool) print('Testing bool:');
  if(arg is String) print('Testing String');
  if(arg is List) print('Testing List:');
  if(arg is Map) print('Testing Map:');
  if(arg is SideEffect) print('Testing class SideEffect');
  if(arg is PartialEffect) print('Testing class PartialEffect');
  
  print('Before call: $arg');
  mod(arg);
  print('After call: $arg\n');
}</code></pre>
<p>I then used two separate functions for testing the add or modify scenarios. I&#8217;ll just include a couple of lines from each as they are slightly verbose</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code class="language-dart">void addOne(var arg) {
  if(arg is num) arg += 1; // Num captures int, double and num types
  // ...
}

void modifyOne(var arg) {
  if(arg is String) arg = "Completely Different";
  // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>I also wanted to test classes in two different ways, I wanted to test modifying the class properties directly, as well as passing the class properties to the various <code>modify</code> functions themselves. To account for that, I created two identical classes with slightly different names which <code>addOne</code> and <code>modifyOne</code> could test for directly. Thus I created the classes <code>SideEffect</code> and <code>PartialEffect</code>. Each of these also overrides the <code>toString</code> method to provide better output than simply &#8216;<code>Instance Of...</code>&#8216;.</p>
<p>Clone and run the application from the <a href="https://github.com/butlermatt/side_effects">Github repository</a>, look at the source in bin/side_effects.dart and let me know any thoughts you may have. For me, coming from other similar languages, the behaviour of <code>String</code> was a surprise to me. But for those unfamiliar with the language, I think side-effects of a function should be clearly understood early on, as they can cause some frustrating bugs to pop-up if you don&#8217;t consider them.</p>
