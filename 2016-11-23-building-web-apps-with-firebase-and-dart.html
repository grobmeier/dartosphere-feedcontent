<a href="http://www.moudra.net/">Jana Moudra</a> is one of the many developers who joined us for the Dart Summit this year. Not only was she helping organize the new, shiny <a href="https://webdev.dartlang.org/codelabs/angular2_components">Code Lab</a> showing off the brand new <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular2_components">AngularDart Components</a>, she was also giving a talk on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNr0F6mHjw&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsILKY-A1kq4eHMcku3GMAyp2&amp;index=10">How to build a Dart and Firebase app in 30 mins</a>”.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bH3NKsRPF1Q/WDWEu8YltbI/AAAAAAAAFAg/PVdCLslJGhMcohOdvnwplzkWz5pVTc2CACLcB/s1600/firebase-dart.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bH3NKsRPF1Q/WDWEu8YltbI/AAAAAAAAFAg/PVdCLslJGhMcohOdvnwplzkWz5pVTc2CACLcB/s1600/firebase-dart.png" /></a></div><br />We thought it’d be great to hear more about this and we’re therefore happy to share this brief chat with Jana.<br /><br />---<br /><i><br /></i><i>So, Jana, this was the second time you attended the Dart Summit. We were really pleased to have you join us again this year and very thankful for all your hard work, help, and support. In the interest of people who maybe weren’t able to be at the summit this year, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about your overall impression of the event?</i><br /><br />The Dart Developer Summit was a really great event and I was really happy there. I met a lot of Dart developers, had fun and saw really nice talks on topics which interest me. I filled my personal todo list with a lots of "must try" or "must explore" things. I am really looking forward to the next year's summit, see ya on a boat! :-D [You’ll need to watch the first minute of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXcNqXbCa0E&amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsILKY-A1kq4eHMcku3GMAyp2&amp;index=1">keynote</a> to get the boat reference].<br /><br /><i>Sounds great. Really hope to see you for the summit again next year. Sounds like that’s not totally unlikely. R</i><i>egarding your talk at the summit about building Firebase and Dart apps. What would you say is the number one reason why developers should watch it?</i><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/naNr0F6mHjw?list=PLOU2XLYxmsILKY-A1kq4eHMcku3GMAyp2" width="560"></iframe><br /></div><br />When you implement some project, you usually need a backend which takes some time to implement. But what if you don’t have the time or don’t want to invest in development?<br /><br />This is exactly the reason why Firebase got my attention in the first place - I call it a “backend without implementing backend” but it’s even more.<br /><br />Dart makes me a very productive developer. So let’s take these two technologies together and <a href="https://github.com/Janamou/firebase-demo">see how easy it is to build</a> an application with Dart using a Firebase in a 30 mins!<br /><br /><i>So, you already talked a bit about new Dart-related “must try” and “must explore” things that you added to your list. Just being curious, I was wondering if you could reveal or talk a bit about what you are currently working on? That is, what is the next cool thing that we can look forward to?</i><br /><br />Sure! We are working on our company’s product which uses Dart on the frontend and Firebase on the backend. These technologies are great together. And also, I am planning to update the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase3">Firebase3 package</a> with support for Firebase Cloud Messaging and provide some more tutorials and examples on how to use it.<br /><br /><i>Awesome, can’t wait to learn more about that.</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>Thanks again for all your work on the Firebase3 package, an awesome talk at the summit, and for taking the time to have this chat.</i><br /><br />Thank you for all the great stuff you do! :-)<br /><div><br /></div>
