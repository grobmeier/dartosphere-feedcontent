It also made it to <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE Index Top 20</a> this month (see TIOBE's <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programming-languages-definition/">methodology</a>).<br /><br />It takes time to build something as ambitious as Dart and, in some ways, Dart is still in its infancy. But we're glad the hard work is starting to pay off.<br /><br />Many thanks to our amazing community!<br /><br />We're going to celebrate by ... releasing 1.22 next week (as per our usual 6 week release schedule).
