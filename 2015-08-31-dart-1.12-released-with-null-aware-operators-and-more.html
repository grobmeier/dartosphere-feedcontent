Dart 1.12.0 is now <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">released</a>! It contains the new null-aware operators language feature, and enhancements to pub, Observatory, dartdoc, and much more.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Null-aware operators</span><br /><br />The new <a href="http://blog.sethladd.com/2015/07/null-aware-operators-in-dart.html">null-aware operators</a> help you reduce the amount of code required to work with references that are potentially null. This feature is a collection of syntactic sugar for traversing (potentially null) object calls, conditionally setting a variable, and evaluating two (potentially null) expressions.<br /><br />Click or tap the red Run button below to see them in action.<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://dartpad.dartlang.org/embed-dart.html?id=b06cd65195ee22e1d95e" style="height: 300px; width: 100%;"></iframe> <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><b>??</b></span><br /><br />&nbsp; if null operator. `expr1 ?? expr2` evaluates to `expr1` if not `null`, otherwise `expr2`.<br /><div><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><b>??=</b></span><br /><br />&nbsp; null-aware assignment. `v ??= expr` causes `v` to be assigned `expr` only if `v` is `null`.</div><div><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><b>x?.p</b></span><br /><br />&nbsp; null-aware access. `x?.p` evaluates to `x.p` if `x` is not `null`, otherwise evaluates to `null`.</div><div><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><b>x?.m()</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />&nbsp; null-aware method invocation. `x?.m()` invokes `m` only if `x` is not `null`.</div><div><br /><br />Learn more about Dart's null-aware operators in our <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/ch02.html">Language Tour</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">.packages file</span><br /><br />We continue in our efforts to eliminate symlinks by introducing the .packages file, which is a new way to specify where to find package dependencies. The pub package manager now writes a .packages file when getting or upgrading dependencies, and the VM and dartanalyzer use the .packages file for package resolution.<br /><br />The Dart SDK still generates symlinks in 1.12, but the .packages file gets us closer to eliminating them. If you have tools that introspect packages, now is a good time to <a href="http://blog.sethladd.com/2015/08/new-dart-sdk-eliminates-symlinks.html">investigate the .packages file</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">dartdoc</span><br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dartdoc">dartdoc tool</a> is a new way to generate beautiful, fast-loading API docs. It replaces dartdocgen, which we plan to remove from the SDK as soon as 1.13. dartdoc generates static docs, helps you search with find-as-you-type, and looks great on a mobile device.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">dartfmt</span><br /><br />Speed up your code reviews by automatically formatting your code. The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/dart_style">dartfmt tool</a> has been largely rewritten to support better handling for long argument lists, smarter indentation for cascades, nested functions, and collections, and fixes over 50 issues.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Observatory</span><br /><br />Help identify memory leaks with Observatory's updated allocation profiler. Turn it on for a class, and track where instances of that class are created. Also new in 1.12 is support for dart:developer's log() function, which your app can use to stream log calls into Observatory's (or any connected debugger) console.<br /><br />Stepping through async/await code has been significantly improved with Observatory's new anext command. You can now step over an await call, onto the next line of your code.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">pub</span><br /><br />The pub run commands can now toggle checked mode, with --checked. Pub now writes a .packages file when getting, upgrading, and globally activating your packages.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Lots more</span><br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1120">Dart SDK 1.12 CHANGELOG</a> has lots more details about various API tweaks. We look forward to your <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues">feedback</a><br /><div><br /></div></div>
