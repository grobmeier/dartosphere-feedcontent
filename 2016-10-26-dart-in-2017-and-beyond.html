Over 250 developers from more than 50 companies from all over the world just finished watching the keynote.<br /><br />This is a summary of the topics we covered:<br /><br />Dart&nbsp;is the fastest growing programming language at Google, with a 3.5x increase in lines of code since last year. We like to think that this is because of our focus on developer productivity: teams report 25% to 100% increase in speed of development. Google has bet its biggest business on Dart — the web apps built on Dart bring over $70B per year.<br /><br />Google AdSense recently launched a <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/10/google-adsense-angular-dart.html">ground-up redesign</a>&nbsp;of their web app, built with Dart. Earlier this year, we <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/03/the-new-adwords-ui-uses-dart-we-asked.html">announced</a>&nbsp;that the next generation of AdWords is built with Dart. There are more exciting Dart products at Google that we’re looking forward to reveal. Outside Google, companies such as Wrike, Workiva, Soundtrap, Blossom, DG Logic, Sonar Design have all been using and enjoying Dart for years.<br /><br />Our five year investment in this language is reaping fruit. But we’re not finished.<br /><br />We learned that people who use Dart love its terse and readable syntax. So we’re keeping that.<br /><br />We have also learned that Dart developers really enjoy the language’s powerful static analysis. So we’re making it better. With strong mode, Dart’s type system becomes sound (meaning that it rejects all incorrect programs). We’re also introducing support for generic methods.<br /><br />We have validated that the programming language itself is just a part of the puzzle. Dart comes with ‘batteries included.’ Developers really like Dart’s core libraries — we will keep them tight, efficient and comprehensive. We will also continue to invest in tooling such as pub (our integrated packaging system), dartfmt (our automatic formatter) and, of course, the analyzer.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oe8SwZKxdqY/WBBqqim2RZI/AAAAAAAAOBo/q6nagVVkGFMlXAAd74BwDVf5QrgTxtJJQCLcB/s1600/material-input.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oe8SwZKxdqY/WBBqqim2RZI/AAAAAAAAOBo/q6nagVVkGFMlXAAd74BwDVf5QrgTxtJJQCLcB/s320/material-input.gif" width="320" height="56" /></a></div>On the web, we have arrived at a framework that is an excellent fit for Dart: <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/07/angulardart-is-going-all-dart.html">AngularDart</a>. All the Google web apps mentioned above use it. It has been in production at Google since February. AngularDart is designed for Dart, and it’s getting better every week. In the past 4 months, AngularDart’s output has gotten 40% smaller, and our AngularDart web apps got 15% faster.<br /><br />Today, we’re launching AngularDart 2.0 final. Tune in to the next session.<br /><br />With that, we’re also releasing — as a developer preview — the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular2_components">AngularDart components</a> that Google uses for its major web apps. These Material Design widgets are being developed by hundreds of Google engineers and are thoroughly tested. They are written purely in Dart.

Thanks to Dart Dev Compiler, compilation to JavaScript will take less than a second across all modern browsers.<br /><br />We believe all this makes Dart an even better choice for web development than before. Dart has been here for a long time and it’s not going anywhere. It’s cohesive and dependable, which is what a lot of web developers want.<br /><br />We’re also very excited about <a href="https://flutter.io/">Flutter</a>&nbsp;— a project to help developers build high-performance, high-fidelity, mobile apps for iOS and Android from a single codebase&nbsp;in Dart. More on that tomorrow.<br /><br />We hope you’ll enjoy these coming two days.
