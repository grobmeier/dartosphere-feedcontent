<p>On 22.03.2012 I visited the Java Usergroup Augsburg to
speak a little bit on the new language Dart. It was a great evening,
with many interesting questions and a lot of fun. Thank you very much to
the organizers of this event! I have uploaded the slides as 
<a href="http://code.grobmeier.de/slides/dart-juga-22032012/dart-juga.pdf">PDF version</a></p>

<p>and as <a href="http://code.grobmeier.de/slides/dart-juga-22032012/">HTML version</a>.</p>

I really hope I look bit better in reality :-)</p>
