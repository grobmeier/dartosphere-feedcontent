<p>On tuesday (24.04.2012) I was guest of the <a href="www.jugsaxony.org/?p=622">Java User Group Saxony</a>.
I met nice people and was pretty impressed by the well done organization of
this little event. Thanks to the JUG Saxony we could finally reveal the
secret: who rocks more, Motörhead or the uprising Dart? You can check
out the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/christiangrobmeier/dart-jug-saxony">my slides online</a>
and see yourself. </p>

<p>The last slide is the most important: the battle between David-Dart and Motörhead-Goliath ends with a draw! </p>

<p>Dart makes some points on openness (tell Lemmy how he should write songs!), future
(Lemmy is nearly 70) and speed (Motörhead is fast, but bits and bytes...
you know). But Motörhead is louder, has much more releases (21!) and a
stable API, er, Lineup! This was a fun evening for me and I hope for my
guests too.</p>
