<p><a href="http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a> is
very young but also a very promising language. You can write it similar
to JavaScript, but it can also look like Java. In JavaScript there is
<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/multi-threading-javascript/">no real multithreading</a>.
Just the Chrome Browser currently does some magic and spawns multiple
threads for some tasks. But a developer cannot rely &quot;maybe&quot; and
&quot;probably&quot;. Dart fixes the situation. With Dart you can have some kind
of multithreading. What Java has with Threads, Dart has with so called
&quot;Isolates&quot;. Isolates are very cool. They have been highly inspired by
Erlang and it seems there is a collaboration between Erlang people and
the Dart devs. To create Isolates you need to know about the following
classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/api/Isolate.html#Isolate::Isolate" title="Isolate">Isolate</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/api/SendPort.html#SendPort::SendPort" title="SendPort">SendPort</a></li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/api/ReceivePort.html#ReceivePort::ReceivePort" title="ReceivePort">ReceivePort</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Isolates are fully independent from each other. It means, they do not share any
variables - no static and no members or anything else. You can only communicate
between Isolates through so called ports. This has a good benefit - you
might be able to restart parts of your program if something goes wrong.
But you need to take care on the two flavors of Isolates <a href="#difference">explained later</a>.</p>

<p>An Isolate lives as long as its ports are open. If you close the port,
the Isolate might go away. You cannot check if it actually goes away
from within Dart at the moment, you&#39;ll need to trust Dart VM.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at it more in detail now. Our plan is to let one class
&quot;Starter&quot; start another Isolate named &quot;Worker&quot;.</p>

<h2>Creating the worker class - extending Isolate</h2>

<p>The Worker class is actually pretty simple. It looks like that:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Worker</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">Isolate</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">Worker</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">heavy</span><span class="p">();</span>

  <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span>
          <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SendPort</span> <span class="n">replyTo</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="n">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Worker receives: </span><span class="si">${</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
            <span class="n">replyTo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Pong&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">port</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">();</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the Worker class extends Isolate. In the next line we
call the super constructor. In fact it is a named constructor
called &quot;heavy&quot;. I will care later on the
<a href="#difference">difference between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; Isolates</a>.</p>

<p>Once an Isolate starts its service as an own thread (it is spawned -
look at the Starter class below how this is done) the inherited field
&quot;port&quot; get populated with an ReceivePort. It means, the Isolate can get
messages from another Isolate through this port.
Therefore it might be rather important to add a function to &quot;receive()&quot;.
Otherwise you will just run the main() method and that&#39;s it. In worst
case you even leave the this.port open and that newly
created Isolate will never go away.</p>

<p>Therefore it might be a good idea to put just necessary initialization
code into the main() method and then implement a method which is called
on receive of a message. In addition this method needs to take care
on closing it&#39;s port.</p>

<p>This is actually what I have done in my Worker class. You can see the main()
method and that I call receive() with an anonymous function. From now on
this function will be called when a message arrives.</p>

<p>Looking at my anonymous function you see I get the &quot;message&quot; param, which
might be anything: it is dynamic. Second parameter is a SendPort. Actually
this gives you the chance to respond to the Caller. I actually do this,
sending a &quot;Pong&quot; message back.</p>

<p>So this was pretty straightforward. Now let&#39;s look on the other class,
which should spawn the worker.</p>

<h2>Creating the Starter class</h2>

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Starter</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">ReceivePort</span> <span class="n">_receivePort</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="n">Starter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">:</span> 
    <span class="n">_receivePort</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ReceivePort</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">_receivePort</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">SendPort</span> <span class="n">replyTo</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="n">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Receiving from Worker: </span><span class="si">${</span><span class="n">message</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
              <span class="n">_receivePort</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">();</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="n">Worker</span> <span class="n">worker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Worker</span><span class="p">();</span>
      <span class="n">worker</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">spawn</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">then</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="n">SendPort</span> <span class="n">port</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">port</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Ping&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">_receivePort</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">toSendPort</span><span class="p">());</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>   
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>OK, looks a bit more complicated at first glance, but it isn&#39;t.
I created a Standard class called &quot;Starter&quot; with a
field _receivePort. I want to use it to get some responses
from the Isolates I create from here.</p>

<p>Then I define my named Constructor &quot;start()&quot; and initialize
the ReceivePort in line 5. Similar to the Worker class, I put a
function into my ReceivePort which should be called once I get a
response to this port. In fact, the &quot;Pong&quot; message from the Worker
will arrive here.</p>

<p>In line 13 I create a new Object of the Worker. No magic, nothing
happens. The actual Worker becomes a true Isolate when spawn()
is called in line 14. After the spawn has created the new Isolate,
&quot;then()&quot; will be called with a SendPort. Surprise - the SendPort is
the port which has been populated by Dart in Worker.port.</p>

<p>Now you can use this SendPort to send a message. I do this in
line 15. I send the message and need to give a SendPort to my Worker.
ReceiverPort fortunately has the method toSendPort() which creates
the backchannel.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-dart" data-lang="dart"><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Starter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">start</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now you you&#39;ll see the outcome. The Program should exit after the
messages have been sent around. If it doesn&#39;t you have probably open ports around.</p>

<p><a id="difference"></a></p>

<h2>Difference between light and heavy Isolates</h2>

<p>If you create an Isolate, you have the choice between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot;.
The first one is the default. So, what is the difference? Actually both
start an Isolate with fresh static state and both can only communicate
via ports. And, best of all, both flavors are asynchronous.</p>

<p>The difference is, light Isolates live in the same thread as the creating
Isolate. One could say, this is basically like in JavaScript. It means only
one execution can happen at one time. If there is an message, then it will
be queued until the currently running Isolate has finished and the next one can put it from the Queue.</p>

<p>Heavy Isolates on the other hand create a real new Thread. It is an actual
process and now things can be done in parallel. After all even Heavy Isolates
get messages in their queue, but they work on the next message only after they
have finished the current loop. This is appealing, because you don&#39;t need to
think about threading concurrency issues.
On the other hand, if you need some performance, you probably need some more
Isolates. But spawning a new process does always have some kind of performance
cost. It might make sense for some applications on the server side to create an
Isolate pool when the VM starts.</p>

<p>And hey, you should know about some more stuff, before using it...</p>

<h2>Sidenotes</h2>

<p>Dart is very young and you can expect changes in the area of Isolates. At the
moment difference between light and heavy is true for DartC (and only if
Webworkers are available).</p>

<p>At the VM side every Isolate will be created as a new native thread. In other
terms, there is no difference between light and heavy threads.</p>

<p>As mentioned, there is already some discussion on the dev side about
Isolates. It might happen that light and heavy will disappear completely
and something else will replace it. Even the idea of using a threadpool
for light Isolates exists (very appealing, honestly).</p>

<p>Thanks very much to the friendly Google Devs who helped me
understand Isolates better!</p>
