<p>Today I realized the third and final article of my Dart series
has been published already! You get it in the current
issue of the Entwickler Magazin (cover below).</p>

<p>This time it is all about Isolates. In addition I have been told that the Dart
series is included in a special edition of the publishing house on
JavaScript. In other terms: in the middle of thousands of great
JavaScript articles you&#39;ll find my little pages on Dart. A good chance
to make some JS folks addicted to Dart :-) Anyway, enjoy if you can read
german.</p>
