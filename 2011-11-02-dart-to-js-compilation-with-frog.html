I&#8217;ve been playing a bit with frog, the new Dart compiler written in Dart. Although it does not yet have all the capabilities of dartc, I&#8217;m seeing very nice improvements in compilation speed and the size of the resulting JS. Here&#8217;s some data for the sunflower and spirodraw samples: Sunflower: dartc: 109,612 bytes frog: 12,131 [&#8230;]
