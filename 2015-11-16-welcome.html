<p>I&#8217;ve started to notice that my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/UKfob" target="_blank">Dartiverse collection on Google+</a> has been getting some new followers. So first I&#8217;d like to say Welcome! While I haven&#8217;t written as much original content as I used to, I&#8217;m currently in the process of working on a couple of areas that I would like to share sooner than later.</p>
<p>The first (which may not actually appear first) will be about using Websockets in a custom server. The second topic is on a library we developed for work for IoT communications. In the case I&#8217;m thinking, it will be mostly focused on simultaneously connecting multiple clients to the same data through an HTML5 page and Polymer(.dart).</p>
<p>I also see there&#8217;s a new Fletch release so I may take a gander at something along those lines as well.</p>
<p>So thanks for following my collection and I hope to have some new, original content for you all soon.</p>
