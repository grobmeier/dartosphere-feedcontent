<p>Since Google announced <a href="http://www.dartlang.org">Dart</a>, Twitter is full of it.
Some are saying nobody will ever need it, since JavaScript is great. One should use
<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> instead. </p>

<p>But hey, let&#39;s face it. There are lots of Java developers out there. When
you give them a language which does not contain classes, they are
feeling strange. If you tell them functions are objects, they are
puzzled. And finally if you tell them that JavaScript will probably not
work the same in all browsers, they have lost THE ARGUMENT. Platform
independence, folks! </p>

<p>Actually you can write good JavaScript code, I have
learned this fact myself. Passing functions as argument can give you
super powers, but honestly, you really need to dedicate some time to
learn it. Especially when you come from the Java side of world. And now
there is Dart. Classes. Even Interfaces. Wow. This is actually what many
Java purists want. Dart actually reads like Java, somehow. Let&#39;s see how
this turns out. I have already compiled it (only on 32 bit, 64 fails -
looks like not completed). It runs. If you would like to try Dart out,
you can download my precompiled package (link removed, the package is outdated.
Go to <a href="http://www.dartlang.org">dartlang.org</a> if you want to try Dart).</p>

<p>Not sure if it works inter-mac-wide, but you can give it a try.
Basically download the zip file, extract it to a folder of your choice,
then you need to edit your .profile file and add the folder, which
contains the file &quot;dart&quot; to your $PATH. My system is 10.6.7 with XCode
4. I guess (!) the package will run on other 10.6.x systems, but hey, I
am not sure. Play well ;-)</p>
