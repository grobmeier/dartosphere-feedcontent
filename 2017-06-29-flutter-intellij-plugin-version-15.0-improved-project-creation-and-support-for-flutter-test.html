<h3 id="h.76bthspcyi8x">Flutter test support!</h3><br />We now support running and debugging ‘flutter test’ tests! Right click on your Flutter tests in the test/&nbsp;directory, and choose the ‘Run’ or ‘Debug’ option:<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m2tRJYOd83A/WVVnwiDvUrI/AAAAAAAAPgo/7Jt6wvbV7G8lASxUpW2f8WvOim8giplrQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/image1.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m2tRJYOd83A/WVVnwiDvUrI/AAAAAAAAPgo/7Jt6wvbV7G8lASxUpW2f8WvOim8giplrQCPcBGAYYCw/s640/image1.png" width="640" height="88" data-original-width="1024" data-original-height="140" /></a><br /><br />The results are displayed in the standard IntelliJ test runner. The support for this just recently landed in Flutter’s alpha channel, so you don’t see support for it in IntelliJ, you may want to run ‘flutter upgrade’. Happy testing!<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wH4NabuAt3Q/WVVoJpy_YUI/AAAAAAAAPg0/hl7_P1JBeOg--Di5Gobjc9xWfE4DMBwEgCLcBGAs/s1600/image8.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wH4NabuAt3Q/WVVoJpy_YUI/AAAAAAAAPg0/hl7_P1JBeOg--Di5Gobjc9xWfE4DMBwEgCLcBGAs/s640/image8.png" width="640" height="127" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="317" /></a><br /><br /><h3 id="h.mlujko7lhy8m">Improved project creation</h3>When creating a new Flutter project, you now have the option of installing the Flutter SDK from the new project wizard. This will help new users get started &ndash; they can create their first Flutter project without having to make a detour to the command line. In addition, we’ve improved the error reporting on project creation failures.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uDSpz8HTvdo/WVVoP96jyPI/AAAAAAAAPg4/x8cHw_7ncyIUTLvduMWzOGOFKDFJIrcxQCLcBGAs/s1600/image5.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uDSpz8HTvdo/WVVoP96jyPI/AAAAAAAAPg4/x8cHw_7ncyIUTLvduMWzOGOFKDFJIrcxQCLcBGAs/s640/image5.png" width="640" height="165" data-original-width="1093" data-original-height="282" /></a><br /><br /><h3 id="h.nj2cbtkmzrou">Reload feedback improvements</h3>Based on user feedback, we’ve made some improvements to the UI for hot reload. When clicking the hot reload button (or using the reload key binding), we disable the hot reload button during the course of the reload. In addition, we clear the console text at the start of a reload. These changes should help awareness of when a reload is in progress, and users will be able to better associate any error messages in the console with the most recent reload.<br /><br /><h3 id="h.4zzujff77e3i">Miscellaneous fixes and improvements</h3><ul><li>Added a new action to allow you to open your iOS sources in Xcode</li><li>Cleaned up and re-organized the Flutter view toolbar</li><li>Improved inspections and validations for the Flutter SDK configuration in IntelliJ</li></ul>
