<p>This is just a tiny snippet for Angular2 / AngularDart that I decided was worth a blog post because it is A) a FAQ and B) has lots of weird Angular 1 workarounds on the web that may be time wasting rabbit trails!</p> <b> How to set the web page Title from Angular?</b> <pre><br />import 'package:angular2/src/platform/browser/title.dart';<br />....<br /> Title _title = new Title();<br />....<br />_title.setTitle(text);<br /></pre>
