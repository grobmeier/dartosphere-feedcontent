We asked Sarah from stable|kernel to write a blogpost as well. &mdash; Filip Hráček</em><br /><br /><hr><br />After spending a year building <a href="https://aqueduct.io/">Aqueduct</a> in a relative vacuum, the stable|kernel team went into the Dart Summit with a lot excitement! Finally, we got to share our server-side web framework with the community it was built for: web and mobile developers who want to build an entire stack in Dart. If you missed <a href="https://twitter.com/joeconwaystk/">stable|kernel CEO Joe Conway</a>&nbsp;present Aqueduct at the Dart Summit, you can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twr3cDFCeo4&list=PLOU2XLYxmsILKY-A1kq4eHMcku3GMAyp2&index=16">here</a>.<br /><br />Our team began exploring Dart about 18 months ago and we quickly realized the potential for supercharging our team’s productivity due to Dart’s power and speed. In October 2015 <a href="http://blog.stablekernel.com/dart-google-language">Joe wrote</a>: “It is important to us and our clients that we use platforms that allow for a high degree of productivity, testability and maintainability. In order to identify a platform that we could become experts in that also delivered on these three things, we set out to evaluate the web server platform landscape and find a platform that fit our needs.”<br /><br />What appealed to us most about Dart:<br /><ul><li>Easily deployable, stand-alone virtual machine</li><li>An incredible set of libraries for building web servers</li><li>Asynchronous programming and reflection</li><li>A simple, elegant language that Swift, Objective-C and Java programmers would love</li></ul><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pBJAsIS_Zas/WCzVJZTY3nI/AAAAAAAAOIM/hMYgnsgRNCo7DxjtD6Wr5G3KMCVszQ-ZACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-16%2Bat%2B13.51.45.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pBJAsIS_Zas/WCzVJZTY3nI/AAAAAAAAOIM/hMYgnsgRNCo7DxjtD6Wr5G3KMCVszQ-ZACLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-16%2Bat%2B13.51.45.png" width="320" height="94" /></a></div>While Dart had all of the fundamentals and a great standard library to support building web server applications, no one had built a cohesive tool like Ruby on Rails, or .NET and the Entity framework. We were looking to combine the productivity of tools like those with the Dart platform together for a the ultimate programming experience. So that’s where Aqueduct comes in. <br /><br />The purpose of Aqueduct is to provide a foundation to build full-stack solutions quickly, but without sacrificing long-term sustainability. All of the typical features necessary for a web server application are available out of the box.<br /><br />Some of the highlights:<br /><ul><li>Easy integration with CI tools</li><li>OAuth 2.0 Implementation and Endpoints</li><li>Logging</li><li>An ORM&nbsp;that makes writing queries more productive, but doesn’t get in your way.</li><li>Automatic OpenAPI specification generation</li><li>High quality documentation to quickly get the most out of Aqueduct</li><li>Tooling for database migration</li></ul><br />You can take a look at additional features <a href="https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct">here</a>&nbsp;and check out the tutorials <a href="http://stablekernel.github.io/aqueduct/">here</a>. <br /><br />&mdash; Sarah Woodward, stable|kernel<br />
