Today, JetBrains <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2015/03/webstorm-10-released/">announced the new WebStorm 10 release</a>, which includes significant enhancements for the Dart developer. The new version adds <i>live analysis feedback</i>, and fixes many reported issues. We highly recommend that all WebStorm users upgrade, and that new Dart developers who want a full-featured IDE try the new WebStorm 10 release.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WlIgIwo8C0c/VRrPS1LWpUI/AAAAAAAAEew/CojErmTILDo/s1600/blog_webstorm10.png"><img border="0" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-WlIgIwo8C0c%2FVRrPS1LWpUI%2FAAAAAAAAEew%2FCojErmTILDo%2Fs1600%2Fblog_webstorm10.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" /></a><br /><br />WebStorm now provides on-the-fly code analysis results for Dart code, powered by the Dart Analysis server. You can quickly look through the list of warnings and errors in your project in a tool window or see them highlighted right in the editor.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ow-MzLSdFDs/VRrPZ5h_jAI/AAAAAAAAEe4/0blrqZFp04c/s1600/dart-analysis-view%402x.png"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ow-MzLSdFDs%2FVRrPZ5h_jAI%2FAAAAAAAAEe4%2F0blrqZFp04c%2Fs1600%2Fdart-analysis-view%25402x.png&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" width="640" /></a><br /><br />WebStorm can now auto-import new libraries into your Dart code. Simply press Control-Space twice, and you will see a list of all libraries that are available. Select the library you want to use, and WebStorm automatically adds the necessary import statement to the top of the file.<br /><div><br />You can use Dart's new <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2015/03/dart-19-release-youve-been-await-ing-for.html">async/await and generator features</a> in WebStorm 10. Asynchronous code is now easier to write and understand, and the new language features make generating Streams and iterators much easier.<br /><br />Also included in WebStorm 10 are numerous fixes and enhancements for formatting, code completion, code navigation, documentation, and more.<br /><br />You can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/">learn more</a> about what's new in WebStorm 10, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/whatsnew/">download WebStorm 10</a> to create a new client or server Dart project. We hope you enjoy WebStorm's powerful Dart and web development capabilities.</div>
