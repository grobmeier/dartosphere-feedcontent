<p>Recently I already explained: Dart rocks. Meanwhile the Dart band has
seen several great releases - it is now time to see if Dart can compete
with the big rockstars in the scene - like Motörhead! Motörhead is a
great band too with much steam behind. But then there is Dart: heavy
drumming and tight timing. Does the lack of a wart make the Dart
vocalist a soft boy? Dart uses modern, state-of-the-art instruments
while Motörhead plays the same instruments for several years (and damn,
they sound great!). Surely there are many questions when one wants to
compare Dart with Motörhead. </p>

<p><strong>This evening is free to attend</strong>, as usual in the 
<a href="http://www.jugsaxony.org/?p=622" title="Dart vs Motörhead">Java User Group Saxony (Dresden, Germany)</a>,
but I recommend you to wear loose clothing and take some earplugs and beer
with you. And <strong>of course, you might loose your soul to the gods
rock&#39;n&#39;roll.</strong> </p>
