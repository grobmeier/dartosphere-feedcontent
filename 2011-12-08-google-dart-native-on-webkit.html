<p>It looks like Dart is going to become native on the WebKit Browser. On monday
some Googlers <a href="https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2011-December/018775.html">sent message to the WebKit</a>
folks proposing to add Dart bindings to the software. Google Developer
Vijay Menon said, native bindings might be preferred over &quot;language X to
javascript tools&quot; because</p>

<ul>
<li>  its quicker without compiling to javascript</li>
<li>  developers don&#39;t need to use toolchains</li>
<li>  better debugging and profiling experience</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said he added the <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/8806015/">multi-vm
changes</a> and the <a href="http://codereview.chromium.org/8802010/">dart
bindings</a> to his message. It is
planned to work on a WebKit branch, but so far not all WebKit developers
seem to be fond of this plan, as Oliver Hunt said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As the 90s demonstrated such &quot;features&quot; are bad for developers, and
bad for the open web.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, people are already using multiple languages in the web - they
just compile to javascript. So Google still is not planning to &quot;force&quot;
native language support for WebKit - so far it is planned to try out if
it works well and create a patch which might help people who embed
WebKit to run Dart natively. In other terms: it is still a long way to
bring native Dart to the all the browser out there.</p>
