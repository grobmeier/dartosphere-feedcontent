<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-148 size-full" src="http://blog.butlermatt.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/euler_portrait.png" alt="Euler Portrait" width="200" height="243" />I&#8217;ve added a new site to my daily workflow. <a title="Project Euler" href="http://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>. Each day I complete one or two problems first thing in the morning when I get to work to give my brain a kick start for the day. Naturally I use Dart as my language of choice for the problems.</p>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with the site, basically there are (currently) 468 different programming challenges/problems. You can choose to complete them in any order. You can use any programming language of your choice to derive the solution. Once you&#8217;ve arrived at your solution, you simply submit the answer to find out if it is correct or not.</p>
<p><span id="more-145"></span></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve correctly answered a problem, you will be able to access a discussion forum related to that problem (the forum usually consists of individuals discussing how they completed the problem or solutions in various programming languages). Additionally a PDF overview of the problem is provided which will usually discuss how to complete the problem in both the straight-forward manner with a basic algorithm and a second more detailed look at how it can be accomplished with various mathematical formulas.</p>
<p>In the spirit of the site, I won&#8217;t post any of my answers. But the site is a lot of fun to get the brain working. Usually I&#8217;ll first complete a very basic algorithm which will produce the result, and then I will do research or even just study my code to see how I can make it much more efficient.</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that on any relatively recent computer, the program to generate the solution should not take more than a minute or so. If you find your solution is taking a very long time to be calculated, there&#8217;s a good chance that it has a far from optimal solution and you should review your code. This has only once been an issue for me thus far.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in adding me as a friend on the site, my key is:</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
