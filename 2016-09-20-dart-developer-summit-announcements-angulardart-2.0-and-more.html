Expect the full program soon on the site, but here’s a teaser:<br /><br /><ul><li>Major improvements to the type system</li><li>Much better interoperability with JavaScript</li><li>Improved developer workflow</li><li>AngularDart 2.0</li><li>And much more</li></ul><br />We will share more details as we approach the summit. Because the TypeScript flavor of Angular <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2016/09/angular2-final.html">just released</a>&nbsp;version 2.0 last week, we think it’s a good opportunity to share more details about AngularDart 2.0.<br /><br />Besides the changes you’d expect, such as faster execution and reduced size (on which we’re already making <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-beta21">a lot of progress</a>), we will also have a better template compiler&nbsp;and some nice surprises for you.<br /><br />The beta releases of AngularDart have been in production use at Google since January, in MLOC-sized apps. This&nbsp;has helped us to see what works well for large apps, and to improve the APIs accordingly.<br /><br />We hope you’ll&nbsp;join us in person or online at the <a href="https://events.dartlang.org/2016/summit/">Dart Developer Summit in Munich</a>.
