<p>On 22.11.2012 I was guest of the <a href="http://jugs.de/" target="_blank">Java Usergroup in Stuttgart</a>. It was a fun evening, with a lot of discussion on <a href="http://www.dartlang.org" title="Dart Website" target="_blank">Dart</a>. Here are the slides which I used:</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15339385" width="427" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> ** <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/christiangrobmeier/dart-javascript" title="Dart != JavaScript" target="_blank">Dart != JavaScript</a> ** from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/christiangrobmeier" target="_blank">Christian Grobmeier</a></strong> </div></p>

<h2>What have I learned from that evening?</h2>

<h3>Not everybody likes JavaScript</h3>

<p>First, <strong>there are still a lot of people who don&#39;t like JavaScript</strong>. OK, I asked Java developers who are not known for their love to JavaScript. But after all, this group contains a lot of people. Some might say, they have not understood JavaScript very well and can&#39;t judge. Well, that might be true. But this is not what counts. People often don&#39;t have the time, the energy or the budget to learn things for which they need to make a complete refactoring of their minds. And this is often the case if you have programmed Java for a long while and suddenly turn to JavaScript. It happened to me back then, I know what I am speaking of.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript has its benefits</strong> - I myself like JavaScript meanwhile (except the quirks of course). I have invested a lot of time to learn about it. Still I am not a master, but I can survive. That&#39;s fine. But it took me a lot of time and sometimes I was near to grief. Lucky me, I have found Stoyan Stefanovs excellent book &quot;<a href="http://amzn.to/V6m9g7" target="_blank">JavaScript Design Patterns</a>&quot; which is not only well written but also helped me to really get started.</p>

<p><strong>Dart addresses the heavy learning curve</strong>. It seemed to me the audience liked the new flexibility which comes with Dart, compared to Java. And that they could still think in &quot;old patterns&quot; and use for example Classes. And that the syntax was so freaking familiar.</p>

<h3>People don&#39;t like experiments so much</h3>

<p>Second, people were concerned <strong>whether Dartlang is an approach one needs to follow or if is just an experiment among thousand others</strong>.</p>

<p>JavaScript is everywhere. Why should one learn about Dart? It is easy to learn but you still need to read some docs and play around with the language - it costs you time. </p>

<p>There is a <strong>dart2js compiler, which lets you build your Apps right now</strong>. If Dart would become accepted by the masses is unknown to me. But I suspect there will be something &quot;happen&quot; in combination with Android.</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/109601534018793668119/posts/VNVko1DaLQF" target="_blank">Jochen Wiedmann</a> summed up what I think on Android thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Had the pleasure to attend an interesting talk,
organized by +JUG Stuttgart and given by +Christian Grobmeier on #Dart .
Most appealing, in particular, a theory proposed by Christian: In order
to resolve the chicken and egg problem that Dart&#39;s not in widespread
use, because the Browsers don&#39;t support it natively, and vice versa,
(and for a number of other reasons), Google might make Dart a
first-class-citizen of Android: In other words, create a bridge between
Dart and Dalvik that would allow to write Android Apps in Dart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, that MIGHT be true. But I am not a Googler nor do I have insider information. It just makes... sense.</p>

<p>Using dart2js is not so elegant as running Dart in a native browser VM. With
<a href="http://grobmeier.github.com/Roadcrew.js/" target="_blank">Roadcrew.js</a>
I found out that the generated JavaScript would take 200kb space, while writing
JavaScript on my own + the jQuery library would only take only 100kb.</p>

<p>But Dart is still young and dart2js will optimize with time. And for just 100kb more
(web fetishists will say its unbelievable huge and not acceptable) <strong>you get readable,
maintainable code with great tooling which even the Java developers in your team can understand</strong>.</p>

<p>At the moment I do not use Dart in production. It is still changing to much.
While the base syntax might be &quot;pretty&quot; stable, the libraries are undergoing a
refactoring at the time of this writing which last for - i am guessing - 1 year or so.
But once Dart is stable, I will surely start using it in production. Let us hope it this date is not so far away.</p>

<h2>A nice evening</h2>

<p>All speculations. What is real and fact: the evening was nice! The whole usergroup is
organized in an excellent way. You would even get some snacks. And the location is wonderful.
I simply decided that I will need to visit this beautiful city at daylight. Here is an unsharp
photo of it. Sorry, but my Android phone wouldn&#39;t make it better. For sure I will visit
Stuttgart again - it is a great community over there.</p>

<p>NOTE: I have been asked if there was only one or two persons attending. That photo has been
taken BEFORE the talk :-) In fact, around 40 people were there.</p>
