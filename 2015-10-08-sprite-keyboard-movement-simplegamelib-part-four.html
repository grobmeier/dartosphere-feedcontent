 <p>This is the fourth part in an ongoing series where we will look at the package I am currently writing called <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/simplegamelib">simplegamelib</a>. Development is usually a little ahead of the current blog post. The projects homepage is located <a href="http://divingintodart.blogspot.co.uk/p/simplegamelib-homepage.html">here</a>.</p>  <p>This time we will be able to move the ninja around using the arrow/cursor keys. Game controls are specific to each game but for getting started simplegamelib provides basic movement of the player sprite. We have to tell the <b>Game</b> object which sprite is the player for this to work. When writing a larger game is is likely that you would sub-class or replace entirely the <b>Game</b> object.</p> <pre style="padding: 3px 5px; border: 3px double silver;"><br />Sprite player;<br />Game game = new Game("My Game", '#surface');<br /><br />void main() {<br />  player = game.createSprite("images/ninjadude.png");<br />  game.player.sprite = player;<br /><br />  player<br />    ..position = new Point(0, 30)<br />    ..movement = new Point(0, 0);<br /><br />  print('starting game...');<br />  game.setUpKeys();<br />  game.start();<br />}<br /><br /></pre> <p><a href="http://daftspaniel.com/dart/simplegamelib/demo1/demo4.html">Click here</a> to see it in action.</p> <p>Next time, we will look at adding a background and some sound to liven things up!</p>
