<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>I&#39;m very glad to announce that we&#39;ve just released the version 0.6.1, which includes a re-write that Luis started a while ago. It&#39;s been a long time since we&#39;ve released something, but this <a href="https://github.com/redstone-dart/redstone/issues/136">has been through voting</a>, and went through!</p>

<p><strong>Breaking Change</strong> </p>

<p>Note that this version requires a minimum Dart SDK version of 1.13.0. This is due to the <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2015/09/dart-adopts-boringssl.html">new Boring SSL update in the SDK</a>.
Please note that more breaking changes were introduced since v0.5, these are listed in the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redstone">CHANGELOG</a>. <a href="http://redstonedart.org/doc/index">Documentation pages</a> have been updated accordingly.</p>

<p>Many users have confirmed using the version 0.6.0-beta in production and things went fine. If you end up having problems with this release, please file an issue at our <a href="https://github.com/luizmineo/redstone.dart">GitHub</a> page. We&#39;ll be glad to help you and improve Redstone.dart.</p>

<p>As a side note, I would like to thank everyone who contributed, Redstone.dart is now community-driven. Your input and contributions are more than welcome!</p>
