<p>The classic computer simulation of Conway's Game of Life, still seems to be popular with programmers. It is not so much a game as a simulation. The action takes place of a grid with a selection of them being populated with cells. The grid is then updated to the next generation of cells. Cells make it to next generation based on a few rules such as number of neighbours. New cells can also be born. End result it a captivating pattern and repeated sequences of movement that has been used to produce music and video games.</p> <p> I have stumbled across (and covered in this blog) Dart versions such as <a href="http://justin.loutsenhizer.com/fullscreenGameOfLife/">this one</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dartgameoflife/">this one</a>. <a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Rosetta Code</a> provides src to another Dart version (as well as other languages).</p> <p>Background to Conway's Game of Life is covered in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">this wikipedia article</a>. The original article from Scientific American can be <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html">found here</a>.</p> <p>Here's the Diving Into Dart version! Of course, it had to be colourful so cells of different ages are shaded. This still looked a bit plain so I added 4 cultures of cells to the same display. To vary things still, the number of iterations is used too and my cells are round rather than square.</p> <p>Live version is <a href="http://www.daftspaniel.com/dart/gameoflife/gollow.html">here</a> and the source is <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/dart-conwaysgameoflife">here</a>. Have a great game of life!</p> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hR444GfDV4g/Uyrn7XE5DSI/AAAAAAAAz_U/UbKlLsCke2I/s1600/gol.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hR444GfDV4g/Uyrn7XE5DSI/AAAAAAAAz_U/UbKlLsCke2I/s400/gol.png" /></a>
