<h1>Dart Developer Summit 2015</h1><p>The Dart Developer Summit 2015 took place at the Googleplex and was streamed online. I only caught some of the content but some great talks and lots of news about Dart in the keynotes.  <br/> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIQorIS8gagUiMau9S84vZV" width="425"></iframe></p><br/><br/> <h1>Farewell Dart Editor (Soon)</h1> <img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WlIgIwo8C0c/VRrPS1LWpUI/AAAAAAAAEew/CojErmTILDo/s1600/blog_webstorm10.png" width="350" height="210" /><p>It appears it is time to bid goodbye to the venerable Dart Editor. Since the code analyzer was externalized, the editor is largely just a shell. The Dart team is putting its weight behind DartPad for beginners and the <u><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a></u> for intermediate to professional. This is just breaking so not all details are available. Plugin support for Eclipse will continue (probably my preferred choice).  </p>Read more on the <u><a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2015/04/the-present-and-future-of-editors-and.html">Official Blog</a>.</u> <br/><br/> <h1>Dart 1.10.0 Released</h1> <p>Check out the new release notes on <u><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/bleeding_edge/blob/master/dart/CHANGELOG.md">GitHub</a></u>. This is new format seems to be rolling as there are some 1.11 details on there too.  Either auto-update or go to the <u><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/">Downloads</a></u> page.  </p>
