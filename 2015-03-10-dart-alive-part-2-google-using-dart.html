<p>Last time, we had a look at 10 sites and companies that are using Dart. This time we take a look at Google and how they use Dart. Of course, this will only cover external sites - I (sadly) have no secret inside knowledge of what is going on in the Google-plex and. like most companies, the more interesting ideas will be kept under wraps! So we must assume that this list is actually a lot longer :-)</p> <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PHEkaqf1VnI/VP8-pzLZQ2I/AAAAAAABDL0/Uznkzv20H7k/s1600/Chicago%2Btechstop.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PHEkaqf1VnI/VP8-pzLZQ2I/AAAAAAABDL0/Uznkzv20H7k/s320/Chicago%2Btechstop.jpg" /></a></p> <h2>Google Internal Tools</h2><p><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/community/who-uses-dart.html">Who Uses Dart</a> gives us a little glimpse of internal use of Dart.</p><li>Google internal customer support tool Built with Polymer.dart.</li><li>Google internal tool for marketing Built with AngularDart.</li> <h2>Non-Public Websites</h2> <li>Adwords for video - Built with AngularDart, this help advertisers manage campaigns.</li> <h2>Public Websites</h2><li><a href="https://www.google.com/shopping/express/">Google Express</a> - Built with AngularDart, this app manages driver and courier logistics.</li><li><a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google fiber</a> - High speed internet roll out.</li><li><a href="https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/">Issue Mover for GitHub</a>  </li><li><a href="https://www.dartlang.org/">Dart Lang</a> unsurprisingly Dart is written (partly) in Dart as are many tools.</li> <p>Google Elections used Dart for an <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2014/10/google-elections-launches-new-app-built.html">Election results application</a> (German and Brazilian elections) but this is not currently online. Hopefully it will reappear for the UK General Election!</p> <p>Very interesting to Dart being used on high demand sites such as Election results and Google's core business of advertising.</p> <p>Next time we will take a look at notable Open Source projects written with Dart!</p>
