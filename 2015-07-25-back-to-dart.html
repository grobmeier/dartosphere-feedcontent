<p>Just a quick update from mobile at the moment. I&#8217;m finally getting time to get back into Dart. A lot has changed since my last post.</p>
<p>After my last post about the Hackathon, I started a new job, moved to a Windows system full time for the first time in a decade, and a variety of other major personal life changes. It&#8217;s taken some major adjustments in my life, but I&#8217;m finally getting a wrangle on things and should have more time for development.</p>
<p>I have a large number of projects to first bring up to current releases of the Dart language and libraries. I&#8217;ll be holding back on any Polymer projects as that library has not completed its own upgrades to match Polymer 1.0.</p>
<p>Just last night, I managed to get my development environment set up. Since the Dart Editor is no longer supported, I&#8217;ll be using the Dart Sublime plugin for the time being. I also setup Chocolate on my Windows 8.1 machine to keep the SDK And Dartium up-to-date. Hopefully that will help keep my routine a little more similar to what I was used to on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>After the Windows 10 release I may consider a dual boot configuration, but at the moment my 2 1/2 year old is familiar with the Windows work flow. Additionally, I&#8217;ve heard issues with the touch screen input in Ubuntu that works well with Windows.</p>
