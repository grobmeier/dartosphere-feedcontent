With the 1.2 release, the Dart team continues its commitment to regular, compatible updates to our core runtime and tools. This release includes improved debugging, faster networking, and Angular support in the Editor.<br /><br />Debugging Dart applications is now easier. Breakpoints can now be set at local variable assignments. A number of bugs have also been addressed, including stepping through recursive functions and eliminating side effects of using the debugger.<br /><br />The Dart core libraries continue to improve with a focus on performance. WebSocket throughput has increased by a factor of 15 since version 1.0. The speed of our core async primitives, Future and Stream, also improved by over 10%.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JlNXYyFTE-0/Uw49S_3Y5mI/AAAAAAAAAUc/qMObMIdwBss/s1600/rename+angular.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JlNXYyFTE-0/Uw49S_3Y5mI/AAAAAAAAAUc/qMObMIdwBss/s1600/rename+angular.gif" height="359" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />Angular support in the Editor has been greatly improved in this release.
