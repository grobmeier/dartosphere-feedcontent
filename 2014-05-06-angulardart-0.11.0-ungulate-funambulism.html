AngularDart 0.11.0 (ungulate-funambulism) is now <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular">available</a><br /><br />Like all our releases, this AngularDart release is our best AngularDart to date.  It includes a breaking change, new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.<br /><br />For full details, see the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">ChangeLog</a>.<br /><br /><h2>Breaking Change</h2>The breaking change first: <code>Http.getString()</code> is gone.<br /><div><br /></div><div>If you said:<br /><pre>Http.getString('data.txt').then((String data) { ... })</pre><div>before, now say</div></div><div><pre>Http.get('data.txt').then((HttpResponse resp) { var data = resp.data; ... });</pre><h2>New Features</h2>We released a few new features in 0.11.0 as well.<br /><h3>Shadow DOM-less components</h3>Shadow DOM is still enabled by default for components.  Now, its use can be controlled through the new <code>useShadowDom</code> option in the Component annotation.<br /><br />For example,<br /><pre>@Component(<br />  selector: 'my-comp',<br />  templateUrl: 'my-comp.html',<br />  useShadowDom: false)<br />class MyComp {}</pre>will disable Shadow DOM for that component and construct the template in the "light" DOM. Either omitting the <code>useShadowDom</code> option or explicitly setting it to true will cause Angular to construct the template in the component's shadow DOM.<br />Adding <code>cssUrls</code> to Components with Shadow DOM disabled is not allowed.  Since they aren't using Shadow DOM, there is no style encapsulation and per-component CSS doesn't make sense. The component has access to the styles in the <code>documentFragment</code> where it was created.  Style encapsulation is a feature we are thinking about, so this design will likely change in the future. Please let us know what you think.<br /><h3>bind-* syntax</h3>We have shipped an early "preview" of the upcoming <code>bind-*</code> syntax.  In 0.11.0, you may bind an expression to any mapped attribute, even if that attribute is a <code>@NgAttr</code> mapping which typically takes a string.<br /><h2>Performance improvements</h2>There are two significant performance improvements in 0.11.0:<br /><ul><li>We now cache CSS as StyleElements instead of string, saving a setInnerHtml call on each styled component instantiation.  In a benchmark where components used unminified Bootstrap styles (124kB), this sped up component creation by 31%.</li><li>Changes in the <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/di">DI</a> package sped up View instantiation by 200%.  This change makes AngularDart rendering significantly faster.</li></ul><h2>Bug Fixes</h2>Also, there are 17 bug fixes and a few more features listed in the complete <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">ChangeLog</a>. <br /><h2>Love</h2>Thanks to everyone who contributed PRs for this release: Ando Yasushi, Arron Washington, Chirayu Krishnappa, Chris Bracken, Chris Calabro, Ingvar Stepanyan, James deBoer, Marko Vuksanovic, Misko Hevery, Naomi Black, Paul Rohde, Pete Blois, Stephanie Wilson, Victor Berchet, Victor Savkin.</div>
