<br /><br />It’s much easier to improve something if you can measure it. With Dart SDK 1.4, we are announcing Observatory: a comprehensive set of tools for understanding, measuring, and improving your Dart code.<br /><br />As <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/observatory/">the documentation explains</a>:<br /><div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Observatory allows you to peek inside a running Dart virtual machine (VM) on demand and provides live, immediate reporting of data. You can use it to browse most aspects of an application.</blockquote><div><i><br /></i><span id="goog_1528702186"></span><span id="goog_1528702189"></span><img alt="Dart Observatory Screen Shot" height="494" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hsExsMCmLwVWtK4ljvpkm-afj8FT8B5MjuWWk3FJ11bq4EWH17Gv-eolTbBOoFa47s69n7p-njkFwEV5nGDtU9MFW89dimC4AuhDuaaC_QCM20w3auZwbJHAoW-8DlIhGQ" title="" width="640" /><br /><div>The Observatory provides information on garbage collection, the instance count for all in-memory objects by their type, line-by-line code coverage, and even evaluation of arbitrary expressions. It will continue to evolve and improve in future releases. Take a look at <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/observatory/"><span id="goog_1528702197"></span>the do<span id="goog_1528702200"></span><span id="goog_1528702201"></span>cumentation<span id="goog_1528702198"></span></a> and let us know if you have issues or suggestions.</div><div><br /></div><div>Dart 1.4 also includes a number of other fixes, additions and improvements, including: <br /><ul><li>The <b>dartanalyzer</b> command line tool is now 100% Dart and runs without Java. Using <b>dartanalyzer</b> directly or via other tools requires only the Dart VM.&nbsp;</li><li>File I/O is much faster, especially when accessing large files.&nbsp;</li><li>We’ve added experimental support – Linux-only at the moment – for <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/d/topic/misc/G9wYnvSG0UQ/discussion">sharing network sockets across isolates</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>For a the complete summary of changes, <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/d/topic/announce/O3qJXkjkhK8/discussion">read the release notes</a>.<br /><br />You can download Dart 1.4 from the <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html">Download Dart page</a>. If you are running the Dart Editor, you can update by checking "About Dart Editor".
