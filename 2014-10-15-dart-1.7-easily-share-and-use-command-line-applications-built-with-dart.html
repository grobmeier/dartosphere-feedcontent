The Dart language, libraries, and runtime make it easy to create command-line applications. In fact, all of the core tools in the Dart SDK – dart2js, pub, and dartanalyzer – are written in Dart. We wanted to allow developers to easily get their own Dart scripts and command-line apps into users' hands. With Dart 1.7, users now have an easy way to install and run scripts built with Dart, making first-class command-line Dart apps a reality.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Developers can specify executables (Dart scripts) in their pub package, which are made available to a user when the package is installed.<br /><br />Before:<br /><br /><code>$&gt; git clone https://git.example.com/my_cool_app<br />$&gt; cd my_cool_app<br />$&gt; pub install<br />$&gt; dart bin/my_cool_app.dart<br /></code><br />Now:<br /><br /><code>$&gt; pub global activate my_cool_app<br />$&gt; my_cool_app<br /></code><br />Dart 1.7 also includes improvements to our code isolation models. You can now launch isolates with a different package root than the host application, allowing for composition of Dart applications with different dependencies. For more robust servers and long-running Dart scripts, developers cans now easily handle errors thrown in child zones.<br /><br />We've also made it easier to install and upgrade Dart SDK and Dartium. We now support <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/debian.html">Apt on Linux</a> and <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2014/10/dart-launches-support-for-homebrew.html">Homebrew on Mac</a>.<br /><br />For a summary of these and others changes see the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/d/msg/announce/ioHy-1IomIg/iZ8ka6BzsAAJ">release notes</a>.
