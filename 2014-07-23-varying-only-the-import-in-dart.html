<div class=top-chain-links></div><br />Tonight, I explore a new kind of <a href="http://dartlang.org">Dart</a> refactoring: varying the <code>import</code> statement.<br /><br />This occurs in the benchmarking code for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern">Visitor Pattern</a> as part of my research for the future <a href="http://designpatternsindart.com/">Design Patterns in Dart</a>. I have three different approaches that I would to compare. After refactoring and refactoring and refactoring, I am finely down to very slim scripts that only vary by the implementation code being imported (and the name of the benchmark):<pre class=prettyprint>$ diff -u tool/benchmark.dart tool/benchmark_single_dispatch_iteration.dart<br />--- tool/benchmark.dart 2014-07-23 23:11:55.933361972 -0400<br />+++ tool/benchmark_single_dispatch_iteration.dart       2014-07-23 23:12:45.545363182 -0400<br />@@ -2,12 +2,12 @@<br /> <br /> import 'package:dpid_benchmarking/pattern_benchmark.dart';<br /> <br /><b>-import 'package:visitor_code/visitor.dart';<br />+import 'package:visitor_code/alt/single_dispatch_iteration/visitor.dart';</b><br /> <br /> main(List&lt;String> args) {<br />   BenchmarkRunner.main(<br />     args,<br />-    "Classic Visitor Pattern",<br />+    "Nodes iterate w/ single dispatch",<br />     _setup,<br />     _run<br />   );</pre>The <code>BenchmarkRunner.main()</code> method signature is a little ugly, but aside from the minor quibble I feel pretty good about this. Exceptâ€¦<br /><br />There are two dozen lines of code that follow this that are exactly identical in each of the three benchmark scripts. The setup and the actual code that is executed is 100% duplicate between the three files. It looks something like:<pre class=prettyprint>var visitor, nodes;<br /><br />_setup() {<br /><b>  visitor = new PricingVisitor();</b><br /><br /><b>  nodes = new InventoryCollection([mobile(), tablet(), laptop()]);</b><br />  // Add more sub-nodes to complexify the structure...<br />}<br /><br />_run(loopSize) {<br />  // nodes used<br />  // visitor used<br />  // (nodes accept visitor a bunch of times)<br />}</pre>I am creating a closure over <code>visitor</code> and <code>nodes</code> so that they can be shared between the setup and benchmark runner when executed by <code>BenchmarkRunner</code>.<br /><br />What is important to me in this case is that the <code>PricingVisitor</code> and <code>InventoryCollection</code> classes <i>have the same name, but are defined differently by the three different imported packages in the three different scripts that I have</i>.<br /><br />This is almost certainly unique to benchmarking considerations, but still, how can I move this duplicated code out into a single file that can be shared? Dart parts will not work because the file containing the common setup and run code would have to be the main file and only one of the three implementations could be part of it. Conditional imports do not work in Dart.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #ccc">Day #131</span>  <br /><br /><p class=bottom-chain-links><a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2014/07/internal-dart-packages-for-organizing.html">&lsaquo;prev</a> | <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2013/11/new-chain-patterns-in-polymer.html">My Chain</a> | <span style="color: #ccc">next&rsaquo;</span> </p><script>var b_links = document.getElementsByClassName('bottom-chain-links'),      t_links = document.getElementsByClassName('top-chain-links');  if (b_links.length == 1 && t_links.length == 1) {   t_links[0].innerHTML = b_links[0].innerHTML; } </script><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JaphrByChrisStrom/~4/Ggd-l7hUjwQ" height="1" width="1"/>
