I had a look at the original code and boy was it a bit messy! I pulled all the web component/polymer cruft out and refactored it to something more presentable. </p> <div> <iframe src="https://daftspaniel.github.io/demos/binaryclock/index.html" scrolling="no" width="384" height="384"></iframe> <br/> <b>Click/Tap the clock to change between 4 display modes!</b> </div> <p>Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/binaryclock3">GitHub</a> as usual. Enjoy! Warning : can be hynotic :-) </p>
