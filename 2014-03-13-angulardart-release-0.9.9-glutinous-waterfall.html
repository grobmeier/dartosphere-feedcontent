<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p2">AngularDart version 0.9.9 (glutinous-waterfall) has now been <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular" target="_blank">released</a>!</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">This fantastic version contains close to a month’s worth of fixes and features which have all boosted the capabilities of what AngularDart has to offer. The&nbsp;<b>hallmark feature</b> in 0.9.9 is <b>support for Animations in AngularDart</b> via the <b>NgAnimate</b> module as well as a new change-detection algorithm and a foundation for form validation and handling. Let’s have a look at this awesome new feature in detail.</div><div class="p1"><h3>Animations with NgAnimate</h3></div><div class="p1">AngularDart now supports animations via the NgAnimate module much like AngularJS does. Historically, with web applications, animations have always been a pain to manage due to the complexity of triggering and tracking animations. NgAnimate, within AngularDart, takes a simplistic approach by automatically detecting and rendering animations whenever the UI changes within an Angular application.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">To enable animations within AngularDart, the primary requirement is to include the NgAnimateModule into the application and then provide the appropriate Dart or CSS animation code to facilitate the animations that are triggered when an enter, leave, move, addClass or removeClass DOM operation is executed. In other words, a DOM operation occurs, the animation code kicks and detects which animations are present on the element (by using the CSS classes) and then renders the animations for that element.</div><div class="p1"><h4>CSS-enabled animations</h4></div><div class="p1">Just like with AngularJS, the CSS-enabled animations in AngularDart follow the same naming convention. When a DOM operation is triggered, NgAnimate will place the corresponding CSS class on the element in order to detect to see if any transition or keyframe animation code is issued for that specific change. The list below shows the CSS class that is applied when a specific DOM operation occurs for the element.</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li3"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.ng-enter&nbsp;</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.ng-leave</span></li><li class="li3"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.ng-move</span></li><li class="li3">.{cssClass}<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-add</span>&nbsp; (when a CSS class is added)</li><li class="li4">.{cssClass}<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">-remove</span> (when a CSS class is removed)</li></ul><div class="p1">One important detail to remember is to include a base CSS class onto the element and use a compound CSS selector to define the transition or keyframe animation code. For transitions, there are two CSS selectors that are expected to be defined:</div><div class="p6"><br /></div><div class="p3"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.base-class.ng-enter {</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; transition: 500ms;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; /* the starting animation code */</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; opacity: 0;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.base-class.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; /* the destination animation code */</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">&nbsp; opacity: 1;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">}</span></blockquote></div><div class="p5"><br /></div><div class="p1">The code above will render a fade animation (using CSS transitions) and will run for 500ms. Once complete, all the generated CSS classes will be removed from the element. The same code can be used using CSS Keyframe Animations, however, only the starting CSS class is required since the keyframe code manages it’s own timeline.<br /><br /><a href="https://angulardart.org/example/animation/animation.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view a few working examples of CSS-enabled animations in AngularDart.</div><div class="p1"><h4>Dart-enabled animations</h4></div><div class="p1">NgAnimate in Dart also offers us to create our own animations that are handled purely in Dart code which is the equivalent as using a JS-enabled animation in AngularJS. Due to the rich object-oriented nature of the Dart programming language, all that is required is to setup a class that implements the NgAnimate interface.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">A working example of a custom animation using Dart can be found <a href="https://angulardart.org/example/animation/raf_animation.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />And a special thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+PaulRohde" target="_blank">+PaulRohde</a>&nbsp;for all his great work in crafting together animation support in AngularDart.</div><div class="p1"><h3>What else is included?</h3></div><div class="p1">AngularDart 0.9.9 comes packed with a rich API for handling forms. This includes: custom validators, rich error control, resetting fields and additional state flags for tracking the validation state of the form. The forms in AngularDart are still being refactored and remastered and the next major release will include a polished demo with a showcase of extensive features.</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">The new Change-detection API featured in AngularDart 0.9.9 aims to boost the performance of the behind the scenes operations that are issued within the scope and digest loop. Enhanced dirty checking, less pressure on garbage collection and even a way to hook into object observe are all among the key features that the new system encompasses. The change detection system sets the foundation for building more robust web applications and is a major step forward for the Angular community.<br /><br />AngularDart 0.9.9 also includes dozens of commits which fix and tweak other components within the framework.<span class="s1">&nbsp;As always, for full details of this release, please see the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v099-glutinous-waterfall-2014-03-10"><span class="s2">changelog</span></a>.</span><br /><h3>Breaking Changes</h3>0.9.9 is a big release and due to the nature of the new change-detection algorithm, the API for scope has changed quite a bit. &nbsp;The biggest change is how scope properties are assigned on the scope. With earlier versions of AngularDart, the scope object itself was treated like a map and any property accessed using square brackets would either set or get the associated value. With 0.9.9 this will not produce the same effect. Instead all scope property getter and setter operations are to be facilitated within the <b>scope.context</b> member. So in other words, all the scope property reading and writing that was done in earlier versions is now done the same way, but on the <b>scope.context</b>&nbsp;map.<br /><br /><div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">// &lt; 0.9.9</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">scope['prop'] = 'value'; //set</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">scope['prop']; //get&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">// &gt;= 0.9.9</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">scope.context['prop'] = 'value'; //set</span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">scope.context['prop']; //get</span></blockquote></div></div><br /><div class="p1">To get a full breakdown of all the breaking changes associated with the 0.9.9 please visit the breaking changes section of the 0.9.9 <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v099-glutinous-waterfall-2014-03-10" target="_blank">changelog</a>.<br /><h3>Thank you everyone!</h3>A mega thanks to everyone who contributed on this major release: Ando Yasushi, Andrew Lorenzen, Brian Ford, Caitlin Potter, Chirayu Krishnappa, Giovanni Silva, James deBoer, John Coleman, Kasper Lund, Matias Niemelä, Michael Derfler, Misko Hevery, Patrice Chalin, PatrickJS, Paul Rohde, Pavel J, Pete Blois, Seth Ladd, Simon Hofer, Tero Parviainen, Tommy Fortes, Victor, Vyacheslav Egorov, W.
