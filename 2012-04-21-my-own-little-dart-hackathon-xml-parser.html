The Dart hackathon taking place around the world this weekend looks like a blast.&nbsp; I’m really happy to see so many new faces exploring and working with Dart.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sadly, there wasn’t a venue in my area (Dallas) this time, but I decided not to let that stop me from throwing something out there I’ve been meaning to do for quite some time.&nbsp; I’ve been needing something like this for a while anyway for my Buckshot project, and I hope others will find it useful.<br /><br />It’s not fully finished yet, but it does parse and stringify your average xml document.<br /><br />Still on the to-do list:<br /><ul><li><strike>Handle nested strings in attribute values</strike></li><li><strike>Handle comment nodes.</strike></li><li><strike>Support in-code queries on XmlNode trees (at least tag name queries).</strike></li><li>Support for prologue and doctype nodes.</li><li><strike>Unit tests.</strike></li></ul>Here's the Repo:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/prujohn/dart-xml">https://github.com/prujohn/dart-xml</a><br /><br />Happy Darting!
