<p>Since starting at Google almost three years ago I’ve had almost 4 different roles, each using and abusing web frameworks and tools to launch applications like Google’s internal CMS, <a href="http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2015/11/how-google-uses-angular-2-with-dart.html">Greentea</a>, the new version of <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/03/the-new-adwords-ui-uses-dart-we-asked.html">Google AdWords</a>, and played a big role in spearheading early alpha version of Angular Js v2, specifically as it applied to Angular Dart (which my projects use successfully today).</p><p>Since then? <strong>I’ve joined the </strong><a href="https://www.dartlang.org"><strong>Dart</strong></a><strong> team</strong> and work on <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2">Angular Dart</a>, and we’ve just <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/angular2">released 2.0.0 final</a>, and an exciting developer preview of our <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/angular2_components">Material Design components for Angular Dart</a> — the same set of components which run our critical frontend applications (you can see it in the <a href="http://news.dartlang.org/2016/10/google-adsense-angular-dart.html">new AdSense frontend</a>, for example).</p><p>Part of my goal for myself for the end of this year, and going into 2017 is to write more, publicly, and both learn and contribute with the open source community. I’ll be initially publishing a series of blogs I’m titling “<a href="https://effectivefrontend.engineering"><em>Effective Frontend Engineering</em></a>” based on my experiences at Google — and will tackle topics as they pertain to <em>making </em>frameworks versus just using them.</p><p>You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MatanLurey">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matanlurey">GitHub</a> to stay updated.</p><p>Matan</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=a1af5c0b6d87" width="1" height="1">
