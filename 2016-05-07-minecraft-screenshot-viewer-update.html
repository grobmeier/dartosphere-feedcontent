<p>This little example was written over 3 years ago and needs a little fix (1 line) to run on more modern versions of Dart. The content type headers are now available as enums and ContentType.HTML prevents the page being served as plain text. Although it is 'Minecraft' you could easily adapt this for any sort of custom web server. </p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nXZmhBWYkEM/UlRiSG0ARbI/AAAAAAAAtl4/j8UAiyGlXmc/s1600/mcviewerweb.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nXZmhBWYkEM/UlRiSG0ARbI/AAAAAAAAtl4/j8UAiyGlXmc/s320/mcviewerweb.png" /></a></div>  <p> For the full code see <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/dart-minecraftscreenshotviewer/blob/master/mcscreenshotserver.dart">GitHub</a>.</p>
