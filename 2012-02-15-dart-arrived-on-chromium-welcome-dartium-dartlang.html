<p><strong>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/index.html" target="_blank">Dartium has landed</a>.</strong></p>

<p>In today&#39;s Dart G+ hangout with the Google Dart team the Developers
announced that <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/dartium/index.html" target="_blank">Dartium is available</a>
<del>(at least it will be available in a few hours - please stay tuned for
changes on <a href="http://www.dartlang.org" target="_blank">Dartlang.org</a>.
I will update this post once it has been officially released).</del></p>

<p><strong>What does it mean?</strong> It means you can run native Dart inside
the Browser - without the need to compile it to JavaScript.</p>

<p>This is an important step for the Dart team as this is the first
browser supporting Dart natively. As Dart itself is very complex
and very young at age, the Dart team has decided to first create
a fork of the well known Chromium browser.</p>

<p>Dartium is considered to be in &quot;technical preview&quot; state - the browser
is not recommended to be used at daily work. It might have security
flaws and cause other  problems. Dart Team asks users to try it
out and report all bugs back to the Dart team.</p>

<p>It is expected that Dartium can run both, JavaScript and Dart,
at the same time. Anyway problems might occur.</p>

<p>Each Dart script will run as an own Isolate. Heavy Isolates in
Dart will spawn an own process in the browser, while Darts heavy
isolates generated to JavaScript would generate to Webworkers.</p>

<p>To enable Dart script in the Dartium browser, you just need a
script tag with &quot;application/dart&quot; and everything between these
tag will be considered Dart script (similar to JavaScript).
Dartium does support debugging a running Dart script which was
hardly missed feature already. Even an experimental caching solution
(often referred as Snapshots) is in place. Experimental, because
it might bring up several security flaws. The Snapshot feature
is expected to reduce Dart startup and execution time.</p>

<p>The Dart team specifically asks users to work with multiple script tags and the Isolates. </p>
