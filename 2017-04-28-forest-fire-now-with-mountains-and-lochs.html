<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The forest fire cellular automata was a lot of fun to work on and watch. It has now been updated thanks to a welcome pull request which adds a Speed slider to the UI.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I extended it further to add some simple <a href="https://daftspaniel.github.io/demos/forestfire/v2/">procedurally generated mountains and lochs</a> (lakes). One challenge here was to keep the time down (it takes a lot of recursion). A quick way to get some speed was to reduce the resolution so each cell is 3 pixels square rather than 1.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">The interface isn't as phone friendly as it was but is still usable and runs fine and at a decent speed. This thing will happily keep a core of your CPU burning so be sure to close the tab if you are on low battery!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Thinking ahead I would like to make the mountains less round and add an isometric view. Feel free to beat me to it with a <a href="https://github.com/daftspaniel/forestfire">pull request</a>. Enjoy!</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P21NKcW7fqY/WQLRBybvftI/AAAAAAABYvI/w2mAIAff1wMEvzqlpxmGs_5UuMAe3mKpwCLcB/s1600/Screenshot%2Bat%2B2017-04-27%2B22-03-14.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="285" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-P21NKcW7fqY/WQLRBybvftI/AAAAAAABYvI/w2mAIAff1wMEvzqlpxmGs_5UuMAe3mKpwCLcB/s400/Screenshot%2Bat%2B2017-04-27%2B22-03-14.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />
