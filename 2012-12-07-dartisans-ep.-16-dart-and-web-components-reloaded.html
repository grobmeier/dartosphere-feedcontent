<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>In this episode of Dartisans, Dimitri Glazkov (one of the godfathers of Web Components) gives a presentation on Web Components. Also, John Messerly and Siggi Cherem (who helped build the dart-lang/dart-web-components library) give a presentation on using Web Components in Dart. A lot of things have changed since our last episode focused on Web Components, and this was a must-see episode if you're interested in Web Components and/or Dart!</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CqS4lnO_dqs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
