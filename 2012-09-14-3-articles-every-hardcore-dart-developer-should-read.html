<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><p>I answer a lot of questions about Dart. Some of my friends are even working on their own programming languages, and they tend to ask really hard questions. In the past, I've struggled with some of those questions. However, I finally got around to reading three articles that answered a lot of those tough questions:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/why-dart-types/">Why Dart Types are Optional and Unsound</a></li><li><a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/why-not-bytecode/">Why Not a Bytecode VM?</a></li><li><a href="http://www.dartlang.org/articles/optional-types/">Optional Types in Dart</a></li></ul> <p>Reading these three articles really helped me appreciate Dart at a much deeper level. If you're a language geek like I am, I highly recommend them!</p><br /></div>
