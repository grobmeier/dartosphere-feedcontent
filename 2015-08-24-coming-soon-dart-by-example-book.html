<p>Yes this blog has been a little quiet lately, apart from Chocolatey updates because I have been working on a special Dart project. I am excited to announce that <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/dart-example">'Dart By Example'</a> will be published September 2015 by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a>. More details soon!</p> <a href="https://dz13w8afd47il.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/coming%20soon%20mockup_OS_4.jpg" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://dz13w8afd47il.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/ppv4_main_book_cover/coming%20soon%20mockup_OS_4.jpg" /></a> <p>After the book, I hope to bring the blog back to life with some more fun demos along the lines of <a href="http://daftspaniel.com/dart/games/web/dart1.html">some of the games</a> posted here already! Have fun.</p>
