<p>Unless you're a member of the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!forum/misc">Dart misc group</a>, you may be missing Florian Loitsch's weekly newsletters, which started in July. They live in the SDK repo (<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/docs/newsletter">docs/newsletter</a>), but Florian also posts them in the misc group. </p><p>These newsletters cover the Dart language and some of the core libraries. Read them to learn about existing features ("Did you know"), planned changes, and how the Dart team considers and implements changes. For example: </p><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/20170728.md">July 28 newsletter</a> (the first) starts with some 1.24 language changes that you might have missed: <strong>function types</strong> and changes to <strong>void</strong>. It also talks about the <strong>unified front end</strong>, and what that means for language changes. Finally, the letter lists features in active development, such as <strong>zones</strong> that work well with strong mode, <strong>void as a type</strong>, and changes to the <strong>core libraries</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/20170929.md">September 29 newsletter</a> covers 1.x <strong>JSON encoding</strong>, and plans for <strong>fixed-size integers</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/20171013.md">October 13 newsletter</a> covers 1.x <strong>double.toString</strong> methods and planned changes to <strong>evaluation order</strong>. It also describes why even simple language and library changes require so much thought, and why they often take so much time.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/20171020.md">October 20 newsletter</a> covers <strong>DateTime</strong> refactoring, pointing you to Florian's <a href="https://medium.com/@florian_32814/date-time-526a4f86badb">Date-Time Medium article</a> for more details.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/20171027.md">October 27 newsletter</a> points you to planned <strong>library changes for Dart 2.0</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/lib/lib.md">docs/newsletter/lib/lib.md</a>).</p></li></ul><p>That's just a sampling. You can find all the newsletters in the SDK repo under <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/docs/newsletter">docs/newsletter</a>. The README for that directory lists <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/docs/newsletter/README.md">what's in each article</a>. </p><p>If you'd like to be notified of new issues of the newsletter, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!forum/misc">Dart misc group</a>.
